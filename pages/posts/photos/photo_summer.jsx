                I have been doing a lot this summer. Got a mountain bike for my
                birthday so I've been really enjoying it. Making trails in my
                yard has been work, but also very rewarding. Also did a late
                night walk a few days ago. I almost always walk in the morning
                so to see something at night was a good change of pace. Almost
                got bit by a snake (probably was way too late). Here are some of
                the photos I took along the way.
