                So my favorite time of year has got to be just as the trees get
                their leaves and the flowers bloom. Here are a few photos I
                grabbed during this week-long window. This year it came a little
                later than Iâ€™m used to. Some of the trees also seemed to lag
                behind the others. Now it has really filled in and the long
                views are replaced with the thick green of the trees.
