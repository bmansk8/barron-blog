                coming in with a more acoustic vibe. This song is really a play
                on the Ruth and Boaz story. Of course I put my own spin on the
                tale. I'm in that period of waiting to find Ruth. Just thinking
                about those moments you might have. Trying to do everything I
                can to get ready for her to show up.

                Spent a good amount of time working on this one. Lot's of little
                musical nuggets of goodness. My singing is slowly getting a lot
                better. Was able to really back off the auto tune this time.
