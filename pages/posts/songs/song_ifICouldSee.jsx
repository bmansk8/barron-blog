                track is my most lyrical yet. It went through several re-writes
                and structure changes. I am singing about a lot in this song.
                Why do I feel the way I feel, how to deal with others, and how I
                survived during the time I wrote this song. In the end I don't
                find the answer. I don't say this in the song but, I am at peace
                with that fact now. I do want to say I was really inspired by
                Radiohead on this one and I hope it shows.
