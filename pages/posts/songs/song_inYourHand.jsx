                This is a super guitar focused take on modern contemporary
                Christian slash modern worship music. I made use of the common
                tropes and chord progressions that are everywhere in this genre.
                As a guitar player I wanted to add some flair to this style of
                music. I think having a slightly heavier guitar tone and the
                lack of keyboard or synth makes it stand out. I understand the
                apeal of the genre, but I personally wish there was a little
                more variety. I wish it was good music, that just happens to be
                Christian.
