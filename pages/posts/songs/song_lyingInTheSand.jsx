                song is somewhat of a send off to the trilogy of these more
                melancholy lyrical songs. For sure been a wild ride with
                everything going on in my life. Some really good solo's in this
                one and my singing has improved vastly over the first in this
                series. As always I played everything (or at least programmed
                it).
