                More of a soft rock chill vibe for this one. Not as heavy as
                some of my other work. Lyrics have meaning behind them but it is
                more open ended than my usual stuff. This track is a
                collaboration with my friend Mitchell Phillips. He helped write
                some of the lyrics, sang backup vocals, and also played acoustic
                guitar. I played the lead guitar, lead vocals, and drums. Scott
                Brock played bass.

                The live version differs a little bit and has a less produced
                sound. A slightly different flavour if that's your thing. That
                version especially was fun to do as we really just jammed out
                and took the best take. All in all had a ton of fun doing this
                song and it's versions.
