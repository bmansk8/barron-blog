        <em><span className="firstW">Back</span></em> at it again with a lyrical song. Still not calling myself a singer
        just yet. These lyrics hit close to home with me right now. Sometimes
        you lose apart of yourself but you have to keep fighting. Rocking some
        acoustic guitar this time. Bass, guitar, and some synth stuff along with
        a pad. Of course all played by yours truly.
