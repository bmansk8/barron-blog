                a title like that what am I talking about? So my topic is that
                of bands that are not in the christian music genre, yet have
                christian lyrics. Why do bands go this route? Is this a form of
                being neither hot nor cold? And is there somewhat a stigma
                against the “christian music” genre. This is a large topic so
                I’m sure I won’t have every answer but as a musician myself I
                find it intriguing why some bands do this. I also couldn’t
                really find anything online in this vain so figured I would
                share my 2 cents.
            </p>

            <p>
                So maybe the first thing to tackle is why go this route? To list
                a few examples, U2, Jude Cole, switchfoot, Kings X, Life House,
                Colony House, Lenny Kravitz. The obvious answer for the bigger
                bands like U2 and Lenny Kravitz is that they are already
                established rock musicians. I would also argue in those cases
                christian music was not what it is now in terms of popularity.
                And for some of the newer bands, christian music has really
                leaned deep into the worship genre. In my opinion there isn’t
                much mainstream christain music that is not worship oriented.
                Sure there are lots of heavy metal and alternative christain
                bands but those genres are not what I would say the average mom
                with her kids listens to. Personally I also find writing
                christian lyrics harder than more ambiguous ones. There is also
                a level of cheesiness with some lyrics as well that has to be
                overcome. Another thing is that your available subjects are far
                greater if your lyrics are simply christian themed. Try writing
                a christain song about a break up, good luck on that one. Now
                the greats like Toby Mac can do it, but I sure can’t (He
                actually wrote two, Gone and Suddenly). It takes a lot of skill.
                It’s easy to add a throwaway line about longing or wishing for
                God, but to make a whole song about it is another thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe my second point is that in the past, aka the 90’s and
                2000’s, the commercial viability was not what it is now. Sure
                bands like Stryper and Petra made it big in the 80’s, but they
                are the only two I can think of. DC talk is a good example of
                this. To me they were really before their time. Kind of a slept
                on band until Toby Mac's fame with his solo career and the other
                members joining other bands. Even Toby Mac’s first solo album I
                would argue takes a step back from being overtly christian. The
                single extreme days is simply Toby explaining how God had a plan
                in mind for him. But the chorus really is just saying we live in
                crazy times. Nothing super christian about that. Switchfoot is
                another example. To me they didn’t want to carry the christian
                band label for fear of dealing with the “stigma” that comes with
                it. They are really an example of that road not doing any
                favours for them because mostly all their play time comes from
                christain radio, yet they would present themselves as a secular
                group. I’m not hating, I do like Switchfoot, but I think
                objectively they haven’t really struck a lot of gold. So why go
                this route? Obviously there are a ton of reasons but I think I
                touched on at least a few solid ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, are these bands hot or cold? if I’m being honest I really
                had a lot of distaste for these kinds of bands. Like come on man
                just pick a side. Imagine if U2 was a strong christian band
                instead of a rock band with christian themes. If your
                Switchfoot, just commit to being christian, that's all your
                listeners anyway. If you're Colony House, dude your dad is a
                huge christian artist. Why not follow in his footsteps! The
                first thing I want to say is that I don’t think this is a case
                of being “lukewarm”. Being fully committed to Christ is
                important, but in this area I think there is a lot of wiggle
                room. Number two, these kinds of bands bring Christ to people
                that regular or “mainstream” christian music could probably
                never reach. The more you are around something the more likely
                it will grow on you. You ever listen to a lyric from a song and
                think “man I wonder what that means or why he said that”. If you
                have, then you just proved my point. In Jude Cole’s song get me
                through the night he is simply asking Jesus to just help him
                sleep through the night. Does he continue to love this girl or
                not? He feels himself losing his way. Lonely days are upon him.
                If this doesn't get you thinking I don’t know what will. And in
                a way this is more of a christian song than anything. It’s so
                akin to David in the Psalms. The psalms are full of David being
                totally honest with God. Psalm 22 and 69 are perfect examples.
                Who wants to write songs about God forsaking you and you being
                unable to see his face or find his will? So are these bands
                lukewarm? I don’t think so. God uses people in many ways and I
                think this is just another one of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the stigma that comes with being a christian music band,
                what a big topic. I think sadly it’s more true now than ever. In
                a genre dominated by easy to play, formulaic, worship music,
                this is maybe more true than ever. Even christian music that is
                not worship music is almost always a clone of whatever pop song
                is currently in the charts. There are a lot of youtube videos
                tackling this idea and obviously a large group of people seem to
                agree. I think it’s a combo deal. Easy chord progressions mean
                musicians don’t really respect the music, and the lyrics are so
                ambiguous that it’s very surface level for the average listener.
                Now I must admit that a lot of people love, and I mean love,
                this kind of music. But I am not one of them and I am not alone
                in this thought. Singing about waves crashing over you when in
                reality your <b>life</b> is crashing down, you're angry with
                God, your friends have betrayed you, or your girlfriend cheated
                on you, ya kind of a disconnect in my mind.

                Early chrisitian bands tackled these subjects. Casting crown's
                first album is full of songs like this. What if his people
                prayed, if we are the body, voice of truth, who am I, here I go
                again. Brandon Heath’s give me your eyes, or I’m not who I was.
                Blessings by Laura story is a beautiful song about how sometimes
                our greatest pains and struggles in life are really blessings in
                disguise. Kari Jobe find you on my knees, or steady my heart. DC
                Talk with Jesus freak, addressing the hate sometimes we as
                christians receive. These are not songs about ambiguous problems
                with ambiguous lyrics. They are strong and say what they are
                trying to say. When you are dealing with something hard
                sometimes you need a song that is straight up. Like Psalms 22,
                God why have you forsaken me? That seems pretty straight up to
                me. I don’t see David beating around the bush. He's straight up
                with God. That is what I think is missing with christian music
                right now. A lack of being real. People looking in think wow,
                music that is void of any creativity and lyrics that mean
                nothing if you're not a chrisitan. Thus why there is such a
                stigma. Christian music for most people seems like a poor
                imitation of all other forms of music. Thus why some of these
                pseudo christain bands try to distance themselves from the idea
                of being a chrisitian band. Christian music is not looked at in
                a positive light compared to other music. Oddly enough gospel
                music is almost never included in this stigma. Even non
                christian musicians respect the talent and skill of gospel
                musicians. There is a level of skill and creativity present in
                that genre that most people can see. So this would suggest
                christian music could be thought of the same way. How we get
                there I don't know.
            </p>
            <p>
                So to end this off, I think pseudo christian bands are an
                interesting case. They are a sign of what christian music can
                be, and what maybe it shouldn’t be. It’s a niche genre that I
                really enjoy. And there are many reasons why someone may go that
                route. I think God moves in mysterious ways and this is simply
                another avenue that he uses to reach people. Let me also say I
                think worship music and the machine that creates it is needed.
                Hundreds of thousands of people come to Christ through it, but
                if that is all we are known for, I think therein lies the
                tragedy. Why is modern christian music being pigeonholed into
                this small sub genre when bands like the ones listed in this
                article prove you can tackle it from many angles. Once again I
                must say this is just my two cents, and two cents is not worth a
                lot in an industry worth millions. But the idea and concept of
                pseudo christian bands was something I thought worth talking
                about.
