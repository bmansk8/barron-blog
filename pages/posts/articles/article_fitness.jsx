                Something I never did until recently. Now I find myself doing it
                almost every day. I’m not looking to get absolutely swole but
                being a programmer I find myself sitting at a computer all the
                time. Now I have always been skinny clocking in 6’3 150 pounds
                but you would be right in assuming that is <b>VERY</b> skinny.
                As a super scrawny guy I finally decided a few months back I
                wanted to get some muscle. I figured as a good exercise in my
                writing skills I would share it here. Let’s get started!
            </p>

            <h2>Running</h2>

            <p>
                So the first thing I got into was running. I seem to have a very
                poor vo2 max (how much oxygen I can get out of the air) so it
                took me a few weeks to get to where I could run a full mile
                without stopping. Even at that I was hitting a 11:30 pace so I
                was a little on the slow side. Working on my lungs was a
                struggle for me. I didn’t feel it in my calves till getting up
                to 3 miles so for the first two months I was just struggling to
                catch my breath. Probably looking like a choking twig hobbling
                down the road. I will say just take things slow. Don’t be afraid
                to sacrifice pace for distance starting off. I wanted to go too
                fast too soon. It’s a slippery slope once you can’t catch your
                breath. Just keep at it! One major tip is do some core exercises
                if you get those cramps in your right lower rib area. That helps{' '}
                <b>TON</b> with catching your breath.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you up your mileage and start to feel it in your calves do
                calf raises as a stretching exercise. That will keep you loose
                and help not to cause injury. Also be aware, don't go past your
                max too quickly. Most people say 10% is a good idea. Adding too
                much mileage will feel fine the day of but the following days
                will be filled with pain and suffering in my experience. Some
                people do 10% per run or 10% per week. Either way, don't
                increase the mileage too fast.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point keep going! I started mixing up my runs. Seeing
                how fast a mile was or doing longer but slower runs. Also
                throwing everything on the table the last 10nth of a mile is a
                great idea to really stretch out your stride and promote
                explosiveness. I recently hit this stage so just enjoy running!
                You are past the horrible stage of catching your breath all the
                time and are probably a better runner than the average joe. I
                could hit 9 minute miles by this stage and 10 is good for women.
                It took me 4 months to get here but it’s different for everyone.
                Enjoy the fruits of your labor!
            </p>

            <h2>Calisthenics</h2>

            <p>
                Some people love weights, some people love cardio only, and then
                some people love body weight exercise. I am in that category. As
                previously mentioned I am a very scrawny guy and running would
                only make me scrawnier (is that even a word?). So I decided to
                put some mass up on top of my tall frame.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I know some people hate this but the push up is my favorite.
                Diamonds, wide, archer, regular, raised, and all the other
                hundreds of variations. Starting out doing even 10 in a row was
                rough. Don’t be afraid to do easier variations. Doing them on
                the wall or with your arms higher than your feet makes them
                easier. Just work up to doing them flat on the ground. Generally
                10 is one rep so make sure you can do 10 in a row before moving
                to harder versions. These days I do sets of 15 and try to do
                around 100 every day. Also be sure to mix it up. Diamonds will
                get your pecs more and archers prepare you for one arm pushups.
                It also can get a little boring doing the same thing over and
                over so don’t be afraid to mix it up!
            </p>

            <p>
                Pull Ups were next for me. Pushing is great but getting that
                pulling strength is also important. Pull Ups are also respected
                by most of the fitness community as they are a great way to
                measure fitness. If you start these at the same time you start
                doing pushups chances are you probably can’t do one of these or
                at least not properly. That's ok! Start slow. Doing these with
                resistance bands or not fully vertical is a great way to get
                strength to do them properly. There is a reason a set of these
                is only 3. I personally prefer chin-ups as they use similar
                muscles to push ups and are slightly easier. This is also an
                exercise where form is crucial. If your form is bad you are not
                getting all the benefits of this exercise. Make sure your form
                is good and don’t worry about how many you can do at first. I
                have been doing them for over a month and can only do about 36
                of them in sets of six.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ab stuff! So I do a lot of different ab workouts but I will list
                some of my favorites. Number one is bicycle crunches. These are
                harder than regular sit ups and as someone who can do{' '}
                <b>LOADS</b> of situps and I don't want to spend hours working out
                these usually do the trick for me. Planks are also a great way
                to get core strength along with flutter kicks. Generally
                quantity is the name of the game for these. I tend to neglect
                these as they are more time consuming and because it also
                requires diet to really get your Abs to show. Still a good idea
                to help stay well rounded when it comes to overall strength and
                really helps with breathing in cardio situations. I tend to get
                out at least a 100 crunches or a couple 20 sec planks.
            </p>

            <h2>So in closing</h2>

            <p>
                I generally alternate pushups and pullups every other day along
                with ab stuff every day and a run in the morning. For me that
                looks like a 3 mile run at 7am then I get home and eat. Some
                people like eating before a run but I personally don’t. After I
                eat I like to do 100 ish crunches or 20 sec planks based off of
                the number of sets. So for example 6x6 pullups and 6x15 bicycle
                crunches. I don’t normally rest between exercises but go at your own
                pace. This way of working out is also really fast. 15 minutes
                tops for me on a good day (some days it's as low as 10). I am
                yet to get into taking protein or stuff like that but I’m really
                doing it to feel good and looking good is a side effect. I also
                tend to only have one rest day a week. Most people have 3 when
                it comes to Calisthenics and 1-2 with running. Honestly reducing
                rest days means not pushing as hard but a more consistent
                schedule. That really works for me as I tend to hate rest days!
                I find this really works for me and my lifestyle but of course
                there are tons of ways to be fit.
