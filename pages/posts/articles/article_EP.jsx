                Making an ep is a new, yet familiar thing for me. I have been
                making music for a long time due to the fact my dad has an in
                home studio. But to actually put my stuff out there on somewhere
                other than soundcloud is an exciting adventure. Also the fact
                that I had to pay this time around instead of simply throwing
                something up for free made me think a lot more. #not sponsored
                but distrokid was super easy to use and pretty cheap also. I
                would highly recommend it. If you want 7% off your subscription,

            <p>
                So if you are willing to indulge me, let's go through each song
                on the E.P. I will say, listen to the album all the way through
                for a better experience. I arranged the order the way I did on
                purpose. I am also saying what I think the songs mean, but you
                may feel differently, so donâ€™t let me prematurely persuade you.
                But other than that, let's go!
            </p>
            <p>
                First up is{' '}
                <span className="special_underline">Morning Dew</span>. So this
                song started out as a showcase of my guitar abilities. I had
                recently gotten into Eric Johnson and was in awe of his playing
                abilities. This is when my chorus always on philosophy kicked
                in. While I would argue my playing skills are much better now, I
                think this song really stands the test of time for being over a
                year old at the time of this article.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="special_underline">Sarah</span>! So yes this
                song involves a girl. Oddly enough I already had the cover photo
                you can see on soundcloud and the main part of the song before
                coming up with the name. The lead lines are some of my favorites
                and I would say it was fueled by my enjoyment of my first dating
                experience. The song has since morphed into something else for
                me but it will always mean something special to me. From this
                point on all the songs were written in december 2020 through to
                february of 2021
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="special_underline">Questing</span> is next. Ah,
                my first song with lyrics on the E.P. So some big changes came
                my way in December of 2020 and really was the reason I wrote
                this song. After writing Chapters I really felt like I had found
                my answer and just needed to hang on and keep fighting. A battle
                scarred warrior maybe missing an arm, or even two, but still
                fighting. The back-up vocals are solid to me and I think itâ€™s a
                strong entry.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="special_underline">Chapters</span>, so the
                first song written to be lyrical. I was very inspired by
                something an ex-girlfriend said. I was also very angry with God
                at the time. Searching for his will and asking is this a sign to
                go and do something else or continue to fight. Ultimately for a
                time I kept fighting and{' '}
                <span className="special_underline">Questing</span> is a
                testament to that but after writing this song I realized maybe
                just accepting what was going on in my life was better than
                killing myself to find answers. Job 13:15 was my rock during
                this time and I even quote it in the song. An interesting verse
                to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="special_underline">Laying In The Sand</span>,
                the last on the record and last to be written. I think itâ€™s the
                best on the whole E.P. The backup vocals are really solid and my
                confidence in my singing had also improved and I think it showed
                on this one. The solo at the 1:50 mark is my best one and came
                about because I came home really upset about something that had
                happened earlier that night. Sometimes frustration fueled in the
                right way can make a really good song. Really though this song
                is about fighting a battle and ultimately getting cut down. Like
                the chorus says, here I am laying broken in the sand. But at the
                same time being humble and knowing I am at the feet of the
                creator.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two songs that didnâ€™t make the cut,{' '}
                <span className="special_underline">A whisper</span> and{' '}
                <span className="special_underline">If I Could See</span>. If
                you want to check those out you can by going to my{' '}

                . Fun fact, all my songs before this were instrumentals, but
                sometimes life gives you something worth singing about. All in
                all really pleased with this record. I really did it because I
                enjoy making music so if a few pennies come my way I will be
                more than happy. I used logic pro to record, mix, and master all
                these tracks. I used both a focusrite 18i20 along with a
                presonus 8 input interface. Waves plugins did all the heavy
                lifting for most of my tones on guitar, bass, and vocals. I used
                the logic drummer for some songs and I played on the others
                using a cheap electric drum kit. All the keyboard sounds are
                through logic and I played most of them and drew out the midi
                for the rest. My main stay on bass was a spectre with humbuckers
                and for guitar I used both a custom SG and a custom strat I
                built. Shout out to RadioHead for getting me through that time
                of my life and inspiring me in my music.
