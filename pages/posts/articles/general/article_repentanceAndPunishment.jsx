                    So I have recently stumbled upon a very interesting idea.
                </span>{' '}
                Maybe more appropriately a interesting thought or realization.
                It stems from what is the point of punishment? Most people would
                say “oh that’s obvious, it’s why you don’t do something”.
                Punishment is an incentive to follow the rules. A reason why you
                should follow the rules instead of breaking them. One might then
                ask why “repentance” or in a more common phrase, “asking for
                forgiveness” is often required. Yet we all understand as humans
                that an apology is often required. It is also interesting to me
                that with more small-scale conflicts, punishment often ends
                after an apology. If there was even any punishment at all.{' '}
                <em>Why is this the case</em>?
            </p>
            <p>
                So I am christian if you did not know that. I will not go into
                details because that is a long trail to walk down in terms of
                specifics. But, at the heart of Christianity is this idea that
                Jesus has come to save us from sin. We are saved by grace
                through faith alone. This faith entails repenting of our sin and
                having faith in Christ that he will save us. This then makes me
                ask, is Jesus giving us a free pass? Does he work on the apology
                based get out of jail free card? Let me first set some ground
                work.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start from a non-Christian perspective. I'm unsure how you
                could fight for any form of a required apology. To me, having an
                apology as a back door to avoiding punishment is ridiculous. The
                incentive to not do wrong is void because anyone can hand out a
                half apology and get off scot free. And if it is not a get out
                of jail free card, why do it at all? Just so people feel better?
                So I suppose from that view, what I want to discuss is
                irrelevant and has no legs to stand on. That is the justice
                system we have and some would say works well. Killers for
                example deserve punishment right? Whatever that punishment may
                be. But I stand on a christian foundation. I have grown up to
                accept this system, but what does Christianty tell me? What does
                the bible have to say? That is the heart of why I am writing
                this article. Based off some recent experiences to both myself
                and people around me I am questioning the idea of punishment.
                Why have it? What is the point? What does it seek to accomplish?
                Thus let me begin.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let me start with some terms I want to use in this article.
                Restorative justice, and retributive justice. Google (through
                Oxford dictionary) lists restorative justice as{' '}
                <em>
                    ”a system of criminal justice which focuses on the
                    rehabilitation of offenders through reconciliation with
                    victims and the community at large.”
                </em>{' '}
                Retributive justice is listed as{' '}
                <em>
                    “a system of criminal justice based on the punishment of
                    offenders rather than on rehabilitation.”{' '}
                </em>
                These seem like logical definitions to me. Let me also link to
                some wiki articles on both of these. While not always 100%
                correct, it generally conveys the common beliefs.
            </p>

                    Retributive justice
                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Restorative justice to me seems to say that wrongdoing is
                inevitable. Thus when it happens what must be done to make
                things right again. How can that person's place in the community
                be restored. Retributive justice seems to be two fold. One might
                say with the right incentives to not do something wrong, crime
                would go away. If the punishment outweighs the crime enough, no
                will do it. One might also say that yes crime is inevitable, so{' '}
                <em>some</em> crime will go away, but for the rest they deserve
                punishment. One is very impersonal and looks like an “a eye for
                an eye” model. The other seeks to restore what was taken/lost
                and to bring things back to the way they were. Even if it means
                an alternative form of “punishment”.
            </p>
            <p>
                So as a Christian what does the bible say? Now there is judgment
                and punishment all over the bible. The Levites that stand with
                Moses and God in Exodus 32 kill 3,000 people who don’t stand
                with God. Joshua kills an untold number of people when the
                Israelites enter the promised land. The ending of judges is
                after the rape of a jewish mans wife. He convinces the other 11
                tribes to seek revenge and destroy the tribe that raped his
                wife. The Israelites suffered immense judgment and punishment
                with both Assyria and Babylon. We see instance after instance of
                God’s wrath coming down seemingly inline with retributive
                justice. If you sin, God’s wrath will come your way. Yet I also
                see instances of restorative justice. Paul for one did immense
                harm to the early christians, and then became one of the
                Apostles. He goes on to write a huge amount of the new
                testament. David sleeps with another man's wife, and then has
                him killed to cover it up. Let alone the other tens of thousands
                of people he killed. Yet he is referred to as a man after God’s
                own heart. Moses kills a man in cold blood. Yet no one would
                ever say Moses was not a man of God. This really seems to muddy
                the waters on where the bible stands. Sometimes strong
                punishment comes, and other times it seems some people seem to
                “work off” their punishment. Somehow they become right with God
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let me ask you a question. Does punishment continue even if
                you “repent” or ask for forgiveness? Does being sorry matter in
                any way? If it does not matter, and your punishment continues
                regardless of repentance or not, let me pose another question.{' '}
                <em>How can we be saved by repentance of sins then?</em> You
                repent, but justice states you are still required to go to hell.
                You might say, well Jesus took on our sins. This is true. But
                let me suggest another idea. Jesus <em>made things right </em>
                between us and God. We sinned against God, and Jesus restored
                us. God did what was necessary to make things right. To restore
                us with him. And now we are saved by the repentance of sins.
                Because God made things right, and we repent, we don’t have to
                face judgment. All of the examples
                <em>seemingly</em> pointing to retributive justice often are
                accompanied by a lack of repentance. Whether the men the Levites
                killed, the men Joshua kills(some people actually do ally with
                Israel), the benjamites from Judges are later restored, and the
                Assryian and Babylonian captivity is always presented with
                Israel’s idol worship and a lack of returning to God. God is
                long suffering so none might perish. He gave all these groups a
                chance to repent. Repentance is how we make things right with
                God. The book of Judges is not a sin cycle, but a redemption
                cycle. God is constantly giving them another chance. The exile
                was brought about so the Israelites might return to God. And
                those who repented before the exile were taken care of. Judah on
                the first go repents and is spared. Christ is now calling
                everyone to make things right with God through him. This shows
                us that there is no way we alone can make things right with God.
                Christ stepped in and made things right for us. Paul points out
                that even Abraham was saved by faith in the coming Christ.
                Everyone is saved by Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
                If retributive justice is what the bible preaches, then
                regardless of if you repent or not you still go to hell.
                Punishment is due. And Christ's death is made pointless. Our
                apology is not enough. You might hold fast on Christ taking our
                punishment for us. Retributive justice is impersonal so Christ
                could take it in our place. But how do we access that salvation?
                Through repentance. Through believing in Christ and admitting
                our need for him. Through our faith in him. I am not downplaying
                that Christ took on punishment for us, but it was so things
                might be made right. Christ made it so anyone <em>can be</em>{' '}
                made right with God. To go even further. If retributive justice
                was the model, Christ took all our punishment, and nothing is
                required of us. Everyone is saved regardless of faith or
                repentance. Why are we called to repent? Christ took on all our
                punishment. Nothing is required of us. Universalism is the only
                conclusion. Of course this line of thinking is not inline with
                the bible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other side of the coin is equally hard. So we somehow make
                ourselves right with God? Is that not a works-based faith? We
                cannot try to make ourselves right with God on our own. Paul
                points out if this were true the law would save us. God accounts
                for this fact as well. God basically cheats and says “hey, you
                did me wrong. But don’t worry, I will do everything needed to
                make things right between us.” That is some true love right
                there. Through grace by faith we are saved. God had enough for
                grace for us that he would do whatever it took to make things
                right between us.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make things right requires our death. Sin is that great.
                Death is the only way to make things right with us and God. Yet
                God has a solution. Genesis 15 paints this amazing picture. God
                and Abrham make a covenant and determine what must be done to
                make things right if it is broken. Death is the deal. Abraham
                does not complete the covenant because he knows he will fail God
                and die. He simply sits and waits. He recognizes he alone cannot
                make things right with God. God then takes up both ends of the
                covenant. God being God knows Abraham will fail, yet he is
                willing to take up both ends of the deal. God is willing to make
                things right with HIMSELF! Christ's death was symbolic of God
                taking up our end of this covenant. We have all failed, yet God
                made us right with him through the death of Christ. That's why
                if we have faith in Christ we are saved. This gives us the{' '}
                <em>option</em> of being right with God. Repenting of sins and
                having faith in Christ is accepting that gift. This also solves
                the universalism problem we stated earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now let me bring out an interesting idea. The next time
                someone does something wrong to you, if they ask for forgiveness
                leave it at that. If there is any punishment due after that,
                leave it up to God. Paul in Romans 12 quotes Deuteronomy telling
                us to leave revenge to God. Only God is just enough to dish out
                the right punishment. Seek after restoration. 2 Corinthians
                2:5-11 clues us into that once repentance is achieved we are
                REQUIRED to bring that person back into the fold. Whatever
                punishment was being inflicted is to stop. God did that for us,
                so we must also operate under restorative justice. As Jesus says
                in Matthew 18, not just 7 but 77 times. Complete and utter
                forgiveness. Go above and beyond with your forgiveness like God
                did for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now if you read into 2 Corinthians you might find that the
                church does have some disciplinary roles. This man from 2
                Corinthians was first kicked out in 1 Corinthians. To key things
                there. One is that <em>he was a believer</em>
                refusing to repent. Second is that once repentance was achieved
                his punishment ended. This tells me that we are allowed to give
                discipline, but only for believers and only to bring about
                repentance. We also see that the church as a whole does this.
                Not just a single person. This is a safeguard we must practice.
                Paul warns that this man might fall into a dark pit if he is not
                brought back into the fold. If we operate under the retributive
                model we might cause others to stumble. It is a system void of
                compassion, grace, or love. I have seen so many times where
                retributive justice leads to more atheists rather than more
                Christians. Let me also say we can restore those people from
                afar. Someone who continues to hurt us is not truly repentant.
                To repent means to turn and go the other direction. If they are
                still causing harm, they are not truly at a place of repentance.
                We are simply called to try our best to help them get there.
                Sometimes from a distance. Sometimes another member of the body
                must do it. Paul warns in Galatians 6 that we are to restore
                gently, but to be careful to not stumble ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me leave you with this. If punishment is required,
                regardless of repentance, then you me and every other Christian
                would still be going to hell. If you truly believe that then you
                have a lot of work to do. And good luck. The bible is clear that
                that is a futile endeavor. We cannot save ourselves. There is no
                way you alone can make yourself right with God. If Christ took
                your punishment and that's it. Christ died for everyone, and
                nothing else is required of you. Universalism is the only
                conclusion to me. Everything has been made right. Just go on
                sinning my friend. And the next time someone offers you an
                apology, who cares. Continue the punishment. That's justice is
                it not?
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are in my camp, try to practice restorative justice next
                time something happens to you. Whether you are the offender or
                the offended. We are all called to be like Christ, this simply
                another way to do that. It is abundantly clear to me that
                biblical restorative justice is the way to go. While I readily
                admit all the ins and outs are not clear to me. It is far easier
                for me to believe in that, rather than the harsh reality of
                retributive justice. It is not an easy task. The world we live
                in does not work that way. But I feel God is calling us to be an
                example. To show grace and love to anyone. To be an example that
                anyone can get right with God. As Paul would say in 1st Timothy
                1:15, “Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full
                acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of
                whom I am the worst.”
