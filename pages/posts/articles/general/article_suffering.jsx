                I want to discuss something that most christians these days seem
                to avoid. It’s all happiness and rainbows about how great being
                a Christian is. If you're a new Christian this may not be
                something you are familiar with, if you're more seasoned like
                myself maybe you have come upon this side of life. I recently
                had my first girlfriend. One of the most amazing and painful
                things I have ever dealt with. It sent me into a direction in my
                faith that I had never gone before. My idea I was dealing with
                is if God is good, and I’m a good christian why me? So with that
                in mind, here we go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me preface with this will not be all about me and my
                ex-girlfriend as that was simply a catalyst to me entertaining
                this thought. I can say things have far improved since I came
                upon this thought. So to jump right in, I really felt forsaken.
                Not by my ex but by God. The way I know this girl I had to see
                her several times a week for hours at a time. Like at least
                three or four hours every time. This was also the main way I
                spent time with my friend group so if I didn't go to these
                things my only friends would kind of cease to exist. I also had
                committed to some things during these events so simply bailing
                was not an option right after the breakup. To give you some
                context I’m what you call a bridge burner. If things end badly,
                boom, gone, bridge burned, I will never interact with you again.
                Now this is maybe not the best idea but you can get away with it
                if you can simply leave the situation. Now I’m in a situation
                where I can’t simply leave. Sadly I didn't figure this out for a
                few weeks and thus how I stumbled on this thought.

                I was really struggling to see my ex so much. But the drive to
                hang with my friends was pretty strong. God somewhat moved me to
                ask a old pastor if I could help him in any way. To give me a
                break from my ex and to get away from the events for a little
                while. A retreat to action as he put it. Now this church is an
                hour and a half away so a big drive for me. God moved in a
                mighty way though. I texted him Saturday morning. By Saturday
                around 3 I was down there and had a hotel to stay in. I would
                proceed to play worship music with them the next day. An amazing
                time to talk with my old pastor and sort through some things.
                Get a different perspective. An outside source. This turned into
                going down there for two more weeks. They got my lunch every
                time and I stayed at the worship leaders house the other two
                weekends. They even gave me free gas money. So It seems like
                things are going good at this time. This is true, but on the
                horizon a storm was brewing.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
                So at the time I had a guys group with all my bro’s. It was
                every tuesday. Afterwards we would go to the waffle house and
                hang out till midnight. True fellowship in my eyes. More real
                conversation happened there then anywhere else. Other than that
                time I never saw my friends during the week. The second week of
                going to Woodstock they had to cancel. The guy whose house we
                did it at was out of town. So it's now Monday, my last time
                going to Woodstock was Sunday. I’m super pumped because this
                Tuesday is going to be an extra long night. We had to cram the
                last sessions into one. In order to go to the conference on
                friday. God forces my hand on this one. My sister tested
                positive for covid. I have no symptoms and had it early in the
                year so I entertain the idea of going anyway but i don't want to
                risk it. Even more so my car is in the shop for an oil change.
                They messed up the number so they didn't call me to let me know
                it’s done. Another God thing, one of the guys who I’m very close
                with and who is slightly older than me (let's call him waffle
                house guy) entertained the idea of swinging by and picking me
                up. But he just went ahead to the waffle house because of
                traffic. So many opportunities for me to hang out but God
                swiftly closed those doors. Wednesday night is normally when I
                play guitar for the youth ministry but way before this I had
                committed to not coming back till the 10th, the following
                Sunday. So I don't see my guys then either. Thursday I’m
                supposed to get dinner with a high school buddy and waffle house
                guy. Sadly waffle house guy tests positive for covid. My
                highschool buddy is awful at responding to texts and
                rescheduling so I don't meet with him before he goes back to
                college. Boom another door closed. I then find out the
                conference planned for Friday and Saturday is canceled because
                of covid worries. Another door closed by God. So I then am
                texting waffle house guy who now has covid and he says that we
                are not doing anything for the kids Sunday and the college group
                on Sunday nights is canceled. Two more doors closed by God.
                Really God, is this your will?
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly this was a really dark time for me. Two weeks without
                seeing any of my friends and the fear was growing. Psyching
                myself up to see my ex, only for something to happen and not be
                able to go. Being excited to see my friends only for God to slam
                the door shut in my face. I’m like really God? Two weeks worth
                of being all alone. Some of my own choice, some not of my own
                decision. My bitterness with God was immense. The way I
                explained the way I felt during that time to some people was
                this. You remember that scene in saving private Ryan where the
                guy is on the beach, entrails spilled everywhere? He’s trying to
                put them back into his sliced in half body, but deep down he
                knows he’s dead. <b>There is nothing he can do.</b> I can say
                even looking back that's an apt description. The main verse that
                I really stuck to is in Job. Job 13:25 says “Though he slay me,
                yet I will trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways
                before him.” Other translations say I will continue to argue my
                case. Job is arguing with God that he is righteous. Even God
                says this, although Job doesn't know this. Because of this fact
                God has no right to punish him this way. He is still arguing
                with God, even at risk of God killing him.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was me. I joked with a friend that I’m like Jacob when he
                wrestled with God, but God had broken both my hips and I still
                was arguing with him. Like God, I can see how much you moved
                over the last few weeks yet you have been so absent from me this
                week. Honestly the two or three days after the breakup God felt
                like he was standing in the room with me. Right next to me. Now
                I stood feeling completely abandoned. As David said in psalm 22
                “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far
                from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?” Reading the
                rest of that chapter really resonated with me. David goes back
                and forth with God. Only to end with that he will simply praise
                the Lord. He knows God will save him. This almost made me more
                frustrated. God took away my opportunities to praise him. Took
                away my opportunities to fellowship with other believers. I
                prayed everyday, God, do I find another church? Do I go back to
                going it alone as I had almost all my life? Psalm 13 came
                rushing in “How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long
                will you hide your face from me?” reading the rest of that psalm
                also really rang true for me.{' '}
                <b>God, why have you forsaken me?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully God came swooping in at the last moment. Late
                Saturday night one of my friends' girlfriend texted me they were
                throwing a birthday party that Sunday night at the church. Had I
                tried to make it to next Wednesday… Also note I would have to
                play guitar that night. Man that would have been excruciating.
                My main comfort in all of that was simply this. Jesus felt the
                same way. On the cross he quotes psalm 22. The God man who came
                to save me, he too felt abandoned by God at some point. Even now
                it almost brings me to tears. The creator of the universe who
                came down in human form felt the same deep feeling I was
                feeling. My hurt, anger, and bitterness didn't instantly go
                away. My problems with my ex and the environment I was in didn’t
                instantly go away either. Lingering questions still trickled in
                every once in a while, but realizing God knew exactly how I felt
                was so comforting.
            </p>
            <p>
                One other comforting thought was this, yes Job’s family was
                still dead, Jacobs hip was still broken, and to bring in another
                figure, Paul still had the thorn in his side. But Paul, one of
                my greatest biblical heroes, said this in Philippians 1:21 “For
                me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” For me in those
                moments I felt dead. I got killed, my entrails spilled over the
                battlefield. But Paul tells me that it is simply gain. God comes
                down later to Job and says to the effect of you can’t understand
                my ways. Who are you to question me? The almighty creator of the
                world. And then proceeds to double Jobs' wealth. Jacob after
                finishing wrestling with the angel asks him his name. The angel
                asks why he asks him his name and the bible says ”Then he
                blessed him there”. For me to stand here and say God is wrong is
                simply not true. But God is ok with us asking him why. David is
                a man after God's own heart yet even he felt forsaken some
                times. And as Paul states, being with God is always better than
                anything else, even in death.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
                So to close this out, I still don’t know why all that happened.
                I also know it was not just for me. Maybe my ex needed a break
                just as much as I did. But ultimately that's ok. Feeling
                forsaken is ok, feeling like God's face, wisdom and guidance is
                absent sometimes is a part of life. Even the greats of the bible
                felt that way. But knowing that God, even when it doesn't seem
                like it, is always there. I will admit I knew this, and still
                continued to battle with it for another week or so. Believing
                something and knowing something are two different things. But
                God is ok with that. It’s all a part of his plan. Philippians
                1:6 says “I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in
                you will bring it to completion at the day of Christ Jesus.” God
                is a big boy, he can handle my real life fears and problems.
                Being formed into the man God wants me to be is not easy. It’s
                sometimes very painful, but it’s always worth it. All the
                lessons I learned in that time make me the man I am today. The
                way I value my friends, church, and the way I will handle my
                next girlfriend. I will say if you are in this stage you may
                think this seems a little concise. You would be right, over a
                month's worth of trials into a single article is hard. I trimmed
                a lot for brevity but that's life. Whether it’s something small
                or huge these are rock solid truths that come from the bible and
                have stood the test of time for me.
            </p>

                I hope this has been an encouragement or at least a good read.
