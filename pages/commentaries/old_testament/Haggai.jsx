                So this book is for the jews that have returned to Israel from
                exile. We must remember that most of the jews stayed in persia.
                Only a small group returned. It was written in 520 B.C

                Chapter one is an initial call to do and be better. The people
                are focusing on themselves and their own houses. Chapter 2 is a
                month later, and 2:10-19 is two months later. We then get a
                brief closing.

                So once again, a somewhat short book. This book really points to
                the importance of obedience as a Christian. It also gives us
                some welcomed context on the returning jews and how life was for
                them. The gritty reality that some amazing salvation was not in
                the cards. A triumphant takeover of persia and eternal
                liberation was not the plan. Yet even in that God was still
                working.
