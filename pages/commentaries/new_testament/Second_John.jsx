                So because 2nd and 3rd John are so short these are together in
                my notes but I will be splitting them up here.
            </p>

            <p>So John opens with some greetings.</p>

            <div className="bible">
            <h1>2 John </h1>
                <p>1 The elder,</p>
                <p>
                    To the lady chosen by God and to her children, whom I love
                    in the truth—and not I only, but also all who know the
                    truth— 2 because of the truth, which lives in us and will be
                    with us forever:
                </p>
                <p>
                    3 Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus
                    Christ, the Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So the lady here is referring to the church and her children to
                the members of that church. The elder of course is John. We find
                right in this opening that John is setting up number one, truth,
                and number two, love. The same ideas from 1st John.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    4 It has given me great joy to find some of your children
                    walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. 5 And
                    now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one
                    we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one
                    another. 6 And this is love: that we walk in obedience to
                    his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his
                    command is that you walk in love.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Once again we find we are called to walk in love. From the very
                beginning this has been the “message” as 1st John would say. How
                do we walk in love? Obey the Lord's commands. If you love him
                you will do his work, and if you do his work you are loving
                people.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    7 I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge
                    Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the
                    world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John here is using strong language to describe false teachers.
                One key fact here is they deny Christ coming. I personally think
                many people are quick to label someone as a false teacher. While
                some things are straight up false doctrine based on your
                opinions and experiences, until they deny Christ they are simply
                looking for the truth just like you. Of course where the line is
                drawn is up to you but John does not mention much else in
                describing a false teacher here. Someone who is like the
                antichrist.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    8 Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for,
                    but that you may be rewarded fully.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Verse 8 would tell me that at least you can lose your rewards in
                heaven. Maybe but not directly also that you can lose the reward
                of eternal life if you allow yourself to be deceived by false
                teaching. That false teaching that you deny Christ at some
                point.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    9 Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the
                    teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in
                    the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                These next verses suggest we must continually stay in the
                teachings of Christ. Always learning more about him and trying
                to stay within his will. We don’t get saved then leave it at
                that waiting to die. We must always strive to be more like
                Christ.
            </p>

                    10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching,
                    do not take them into your house or welcome them. 11 Anyone
                    who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John then states firmly anyone who says otherwise is not to be
                welcomed.
            </p>
            <p>John then closes this letter.</p>

                    12 I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use
                    paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with
                    you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
                </p>

                    13 The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send
                    their greetings.

            <p>
                These letters were written before John was banished to patmos so
                it is not odd he would want to see them in person. This ending
                also reminds me of Paul in that both these men would have
                preferred to talk in person. John is using the sister being the
                church metaphor again saying “the children of your sister”.
                Basically a sister congregation sends its greetings.
