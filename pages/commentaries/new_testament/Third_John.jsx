                So because 2nd and 3rd John are so short these are together in
                my notes but I will be splitting them up here.

                    This letter is a note of thanks and encouragement to an
                    individual named Gaius. John had sent a letter to the church
                    of which Gaius was a member, introducing and commending
                    certain individuals, but a leader named Diotrephes refused
                    to accommodate them. He opposed John’s authority to the
                    point of actually expelling anyone who supported the people
                    he had sent. Gaius, however, put these preachers up in his
                    own home, enabling them to carry out their mission. John’s
                    gratitude makes it clear that the church should provide a
                    base of operations for traveling preachers who were walking
                    in the truth. John also promises to come soon to set matters
                    right.

                <h1>3 John</h1>
                <p>1 The elder,</p>
                <p>To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    2 Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and
                    that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting
                    along well. 3 It gave me great joy when some believers came
                    and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling
                    how you continue to walk in it. 4 I have no greater joy than
                    to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
                </p>

                This is very akin to Paul's letter to the Phillipians. For a
                christian, there is no greater joy than to hear about a fellow
                christian staying strong in the faith and spreading the gospel.
                When you see someone else doing it I find it is encouragement
                that I can do it also.

                    5 Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for
                    the brothers and sisters, even though they are strangers to
                    you. 6 They have told the church about your love. Please
                    send them on their way in a manner that honors God. 7 It was
                    for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no
                    help from the pagans. 8 We ought therefore to show
                    hospitality to such people so that we may work together for
                    the truth.

                This is calling back to the old testament style of welcoming
                people into the home. We should be willing to help any christian
                in need so Christ love might be seen through us. People who give
                their life to the faith rely on everyday christians to help them
                in all kinds of ways. We are all a part of one body and must do
                our part.

                    9 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be
                    first, will not welcome us. 10 So when I come, I will call
                    attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense
                    about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to
                    welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do
                    so and puts them out of the church.

                So John seems to state the reason for this man doing all this is
                pride. “Who loves to be first”. Seems he is even putting himself
                above God. he for sure thinks he is better than John, who is an
                apostle by the way. Even kicking people out of the church who
                follow John and his advice. He is actively not being hospitable
                to fellow believers.

                    11 Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is
                    good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who
                    does what is evil has not seen God. 12 Demetrius is well
                    spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also
                    speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.

            <p>
                John warns to not follow this bad example. Apparently there was
                a guy named Demetrius who was a good christian. You must be if
                the spirit testifies about you along with an apostle. Enduring
                word suggests that Demetrius might have been the one who
                delivered the letter. Perhaps John wanted to assure Gaius he
                should show this man hospitality.

                    13 I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with
                    pen and ink. 14 I hope to see you soon, and we will talk
                    face to face.

                Once again John wishes to talk in person. Intense persecution
                was happening at this time so I’m unsure if John ever visited
                any of the churches talked about in 1-3 John. Even being so
                short these letters are great single issue case studies on what
                to do in these all too common scenarios. 1 John in particular is
                interesting, probably having some of the new testament available
                to reference as these letters are so much farther off. As 2
                Timothy 3 would say
            </p>

                    that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every
                    good work.
