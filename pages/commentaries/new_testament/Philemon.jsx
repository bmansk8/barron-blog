            <p>
                So Philemon is a letter Paul writes to Philemon and members of
                the church at colossae.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul is in prison at this time. The overarching idea is that
                Philemon should offer grace and forgiveness to his runaway slave
                Onesimus.

                So Paul is writing this letter with the help of Timothy while he
                is in prison. This church meets in Philemon's home. Just like in
                Philippians whenever Paul thinks of them or prays for them he is
                filled with joy. This church is doing good things and furthering
                God’s kingdom.

                        8 Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and
                        order you to do what you ought to do, 9 yet I prefer to
                        appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other
                        than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ
                        Jesus— 10 that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who
                        became my son while I was in chains. 11 Formerly he was
                        useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you
                        and to me.

            <p>
                So Paul let’s Philemon know that on one hand Paul has the
                authority to demand he take back and forgive Onesimus. Paul does
                exactly this in his letters to the church in Corinth. Paul is
                also referencing being a slave to Jesus here just like he does
                in chapter two of second Corinthians. Paul instead, out of love,
                appeals to Philemon. Obviously Onesimus has been helping Paul in
                prison and somehow got all the way to where Paul is being held
                in rome. Paul also states he was useless but now is useful to
                both Paul and Philemon. When he was but a slave he meant nothing
                but now as a follower of Christ he can help spread the gospel.

                        I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could
                        take your place in helping me while I am in chains for
                        the gospel. 14 But I did not want to do anything without
                        your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem
                        forced but would be voluntary. 15 Perhaps the reason he
                        was separated from you for a little while was that you
                        might have him back forever— 16 no longer as a slave,
                        but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very
                        dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man
                        and as a brother in the Lord.

                Paul decides to send Onesimus back to Philemon. Paul says he is
                his very heart. Paul considers this guy an equal. Paul wishes he
                could keep him around saying he would fill Philemon's role of
                helping Paul, also showing he is an equal when compared to
                Philemon. Paul is careful here and appeals to Philemon. He wants
                this to be a voluntary choice. Not something Paul forces on him.
                Verse 15 suggests Paul is unaware or really doesn't care what
                Onesimus has done wrong to Philemon. Philemon should take him
                back as a brother in Christ, no longer a slave. Paul even says
                he is dear to him but should be even more important to Philemon
                and to treat him as a brother.

                Paul then puts some skin in the game. He challenges Philemon to
                treat this man like it was Paul visiting, and as such, whatever
                debt this man has, Paul will pay it. Paul affirms that it is he
                who is writing and will pay Philemon back. Paul, always the
                savage, also throws in that Philemon himself owes Paul something
                and yet Paul still loves him. Paul begins his closing words with
                that he knows Philemon will do as Paul asks and probably more.
                He also urges him to prepare a room because when Paul gets out
                of prison he wants to go see him. Paul then lists some people
                who are with him. It's cool to me to see how Paul was not alone.
                He was the farthest thing from a lone ranger. Even in verse 20
                the almighty holy Paul needs some refreshment of Christ in his
                heart sometimes. This letter is also after his two letters to
                Corinth so Paul has vast amounts of experience in dealing with
                harsh subjects and dealing with people who sometimes don’t want
                to do what you want them to do. After many letters and dealing
                with Corinth I'm sure he doesn't want the church of colossae to
                end up like Corinth, always fighting with Paul. He has the
                authority to force them in a sense to do what is right, he does
                that with Corinth, but he would rather them willingly do these
                things at Paul's request. As just like with Corinth and a lot of
                the churches Paul writes to, he wishes to visit them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul's love for the church is awe inspiring to me. His love for
                the unsaved is also great. He wishes everyone would be saved.
                But most of all his humility is so great. He is but a slave to
                God that people may see Christ in him. I wonder if Paul mellows
                as the years go bye. The savage Paul is still there, but his
                eagerness to get into it with people has waned a bit I think.

                Paul having reconciled with John-Mark and apparently having to
                split ways with Barnabas as to not hinder the spread of the
                gospel, Paul has some first hand knowledge of offering
                forgiveness and what to do when things just don’t work out. Even
                in Paul's letter to Colossae he says to welcome Barnabas if he
                arrives. For such a small book there is a large amount of wisdom
                and good spiritual and practical food to chew on as a christian.
