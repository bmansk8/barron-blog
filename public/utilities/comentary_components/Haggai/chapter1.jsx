                <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
                <p>
                    1 In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of
                    the sixth month, the word of the Lord came by the prophet
                    Haggai to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
                    Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
                    saying, 2 “This is what the Lord of armies says: ‘This
                    people says, “The time has not come, the time for the house
                    of the Lord to be rebuilt.” ’ ”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God is like hey, why are you not rebuilding the temple first?
                I need to be your priority. God is even referring to himself as
                lord of armies just like in Malachi.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    3 Then the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet,
                    saying, 4 “Is it time for you yourselves to live in your
                    paneled houses while this house remains desolate?”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So this reminds me of David when he wanted to build the temple.
                David was living in a grand palace, yet God was in a tent. I
                think the main thing is not necessarily the temple as much as
                their priority. Where was their heart at? It seems God was
                somewhere on the list, but pretty far down.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    5 Now then, the Lord of armies says this: “Consider your
                    ways! 6 You have sown much, only to harvest little; you eat,
                    but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but
                    there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing,
                    but there is not enough for anyone to get warm; and the one
                    who earns, earns wages to put into a money bag full of
                    holes.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So it seems these returning jews were doing a lot of work,
                without much gain. He is calling them to ask why this is the
                case.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    7 The Lord of armies says this: “Consider your ways! 8 Go up
                    to the mountains, bring wood, and rebuild the temple, that I
                    may be pleased with it and be honored,” says the Lord. 9
                    “You start an ambitious project, but behold, it comes to
                    little; when you bring it home, I blow it away. Why?”
                    declares the Lord of armies. “It is because of My house
                    which remains desolate, while each of you runs to his own
                    house.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God is clueing them in on that he is withholding his
                blessings from them. Their priorities are not straight. They are
                focused on themselves instead of God.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    10 Therefore, because of you the sky has withheld its dew,
                    and the earth has withheld its produce. 11 And I called for
                    a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on
                    the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground produces, on
                    mankind, on cattle, and on all the products of the labor of
                    your hands.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God has allowed life to be ten times harder because they are
                not seeking him. It’s interesting because the jews have two ways
                of being here. 1 is that they don’t trust God to provide for
                them until the temple is built. They think they need to set
                themselves up before they can try to set up God. The other might
                be a misplaced idea that it’s what they deserve. This is par for
                the course after everything else that has happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                God is telling them hey look, I want to bless you! But you have
                to get your priorities straight first. This is the reason you
                are back here, yet you are not doing it.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son
                    of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the
                    people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the words
                    of Haggai the prophet, just as the Lord their God had sent
                    him. And the people showed reverence for the Lord.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>So for once the people obey! Truly a miracle.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the Lord, spoke by the
                    commission of the Lord to the people, saying, “ ‘I am with
                    you,’ declares the Lord.” 14 So the Lord stirred up the
                    spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
                    Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the
                    high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the
                    people; and they came and worked on the house of the Lord of
                    armies, their God, 15 on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth
                    month in the second year of Darius the king.

            </div>

            <p>
                So obedience leads to God being for you and not against you.
                With God backing us, how can we fail in accomplishing his will?
