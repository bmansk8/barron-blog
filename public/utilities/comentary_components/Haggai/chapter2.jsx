                <p>
                    1 On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the
                    Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 2 “Speak now to
                    Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to
                    Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the
                    remnant of the people, saying, 3 ‘Who is left among you who
                    saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it
                    now? Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison?
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So here we are a month later. It’s interesting to me because
                chances are anyone who knew the temple before is dead or
                couldn’t make the journey back. I suppose these people did
                understand that it was not as awesome as Solomon's temple. It
                seems this led to some discouragement.
            </p>

                    4 But now take courage, Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord,
                    ‘take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high
                    priest, and all you people of the land take courage,’
                    declares the Lord, ‘and work; for I am with you,’ declares
                    the Lord of armies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                God says, you did your part, now I will do mine. Be encouraged
                because I am with you!
            </p>

            <div className="bible">

                    5 ‘As for the promise which I made you when you came out of
                    Egypt, My Spirit remains in your midst; do not fear!’ 6 For
                    this is what the Lord of armies says: ‘Once more in a little
                    while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the
                    sea also and the dry land. 7 I will shake all the nations;
                    and they will come with the wealth of all nations, and I
                    will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord of armies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So this comes true. Herod's temple is pretty amazing. And it’s
                splendor does not come from the jews but from the Nabateans,
                whom Herod identified as. Immense amounts of wealth.
            </p>

                    8 ‘The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,’ declares the
                    Lord of armies. 9 ‘The latter glory of this house will be
                    greater than the former,’ says the Lord of armies, ‘and in
                    this place I will give peace,’ declares the Lord of armies.”

            <p>
                One might also point to that post Christ, now the Lord lives in
                all of us. We, the body, are the new temple. Greater than ever
                before.

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    10 On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, in the second
                    year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Haggai the
                    prophet, saying, 11 “The Lord of armies says this: ‘Now ask
                    the priests for a ruling: 12 If someone carries holy meat in
                    the fold of his garment, and touches bread with this fold,
                    or touches cooked food, wine, oil, or any other food, will
                    it become holy?’ ” And the priests answered, “No.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So Haggai then checks in again 2 months later. He poses a
                question to the priest. If you go around touching everything
                with something unclean, are you not making everything unclean
                also?
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    13 Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean from a corpse
                    touches any of these things, will the latter become
                    unclean?” And the priests answered, “It will become
                    unclean.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So apparently some of these jews were not following Torah
                completely.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    14 Then Haggai responded and said, “ ‘So is this people. And
                    so is this nation before Me,’ declares the Lord, ‘and so is
                    every work of their hands; and what they offer there is
                    unclean.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The nation must cleanse themselves before they can continue to
                worship God.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">

                    15 But now, do consider from this day onward: before one
                    stone was placed on another in the temple of the Lord, 16
                    from that time when one came to a grain heap of twenty
                    measures, there would be only ten; and when one came to the
                    wine vat to draw fifty measures, there would be only twenty.
                    17 I struck you and every work of your hands with scorching
                    wind, mildew, and hail; yet you did not come back to Me,’
                    declares the Lord.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God reminds them that when they are not with him, they don’t
                receive his blessings. Yet this doesn’t seem to be the best
                teaching tool. Even with all they continued to stray from God.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    18 ‘Do consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth
                    day of the ninth month; from the day when the temple of the
                    Lord was founded, consider: 19 Is the seed still in the
                    barn? Even including the vine, the fig tree, the
                    pomegranate, and the olive tree, it has not produced fruit.
                    Yet from this day on I will bless you.’ ”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God promises blessings if they simply obey. Follow me, and I
                will bless you.

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    20 Then the word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on
                    the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, 21 “Speak to
                    Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying, ‘I am going to shake
                    the heavens and the earth. 22 And I will overthrow the
                    thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of
                    the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their
                    riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, every
                    one by the sword of another.’ 23 ‘On that day,’ declares the
                    Lord of armies, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of
                    Shealtiel, My servant,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will make
                    you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ ” declares
                    the Lord of armies.

            <p>
                So this is a huge section. Honestly I struggled to have anything
                to say, but Enduring Word had some great aspects to talk about.
            </p>

                        {' '}
                        I will take you, Zerubbabel… and will make you like a
                        signet ring
                    </strong>
                    : The signet ring was a token of royal authority much like a
                    throne, a crown, or a scepter.

                <p>
                    i. “This is not a personal assurance only to Zerubbabel, for
                    neither he nor his natural seed reigned in Jerusalem, or
                    rose to any special eminence in the kingdoms of this world.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    b.<strong> For I have chosen you</strong>: Zerubbabel was
                    truly chosen of God. In the ancestry of Jesus, Zerubbabel
                    was the last person to stand to be in both the line of Mary
                    (the blood lineage of Jesus –{' '}
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+3.27&t=NKJV">
                        Luke 3:27
                    </a>
                    ) and Joseph (the legal lineage of Jesus through Joseph –{' '}
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+1.12&t=NKJV">
                        Matthew 1:12
                    </a>
                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. God used these two lines of ancestry for Jesus because He
                    placed a curse on the seed of Jechoniah (also known as
                    Coniah or Jehoiachin) as recorded in{' '}
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Jeremiah+22.30&t=NKJV">
                        Jeremiah 22:30
                    </a>
                    . That line was royal line of David, so if the Messiah was
                    to qualify for the throne of David (
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+1.31-33&t=NKJV">
                        Luke 1:31-33
                    </a>
                    ), he had to be of the legal line of David, yet not of his
                    seed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. Jechoniah was the last legitimate king of Judah and the
                    royal House of David goes through him. His only successor
                    was Zedekiah, his uncle who was appointed not by right, but
                    by an occupying Babylonian ruler (
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=2Kings+24.17-20&t=NKJV">
                        2 Kings 24:17-20
                    </a>
                    ). Even at the end of his life, the Babylonians recognized
                    Jechoniah as the legitimate king of Judah (
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=2Kings+25.27-30&t=NKJV">
                        2 Kings 25:27-30
                    </a>
                    )
                </p>
                <p>
                    iii. Because Zerubbabel was a descendant of the last
                    legitimate king of Judah, he could be legitimately
                    recognized as the ruler (though not king) of the returning
                    exiles.

                This is some super interesting stuff to think about. I was
