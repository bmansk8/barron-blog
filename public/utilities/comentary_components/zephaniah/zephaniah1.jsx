                <p>
                    1 The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi,
                    son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the
                    days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:
                </p>
                <p>So we get our classic opening for this style of book.</p>
                <p>2 “I will completely remove all things</p>
                <p>From the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.</p>
                <p>3 “I will remove human and animal life;</p>
                <p>I will remove the birds of the sky</p>
                <p>And the fish of the sea,</p>
                <p>And the ruins along with the wicked;</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                And I will eliminate mankind from the face of the earth,”
                declares the Lord.
            </p>
            <p>
                So we start off bold. Strong words of judgment. Complete and
                utter destruction.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>4 “So I will stretch out My hand against Judah</p>
                <p>And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>And I will eliminate the remnant of Baal from this place,</p>
                <p>
                    And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the other
                    priests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5 And those who bow down on the housetops to the heavenly
                    lights,
                </p>
                <p>
                    And those who bow down and swear to the Lord, but also swear
                    by Milcom,
                </p>
                <p>6 And those who have turned back from following the Lord,</p>
                <p>
                    And those who have not sought the Lord nor inquired of Him.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God will stretch out his hand and deliver judgment to those
                who are worshipping idols. We even see people worshipping God,
                but also other gods. God wants our complete devotion. Not half
                hearted followers.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>7 Be silent before the Lord God!</p>
                <p>For the day of the Lord is near,</p>
                <p>Because the Lord has prepared a sacrifice,</p>
                <p>He has consecrated His guests.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The Lord has made his sacrifice. He has made his guests clean.
                Yet these people have no reverence for God. Thus his judgment is
                fast approaching.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    8 “Then it will come about on the day of the Lord’s
                    sacrifice
                </p>
                <p>That I will punish the princes, the king’s sons,</p>
                <p>And all who clothe themselves with foreign garments.</p>
                <p>
                    9 And on that day I will punish all who leap on the temple
                    threshold,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So the king and all these prominent figures will be dealt with.
                Also most likely the priest who seeks God when trouble comes,
                yet has no true respect for him. He proclaims faith in God, yet
                he promotes idol worship. Even in the temple!
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>10 And on that day,” declares the Lord,</p>
                <p>“There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate,</p>
                <p>Wailing from the Second Quarter,</p>
                <p>And a loud crash from the hills.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God is willing to give us specifics about what will go down.
                His will is going to happen with utmost certainty.
            </p>

                Great article on the fish gate{' '}

                    The Gates of Jerusalem: The Fish Gate

            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>11 Wail, you inhabitants of the Mortar,</p>
                <p>Because all the people of Canaan will be destroyed;</p>
                <p>All who weigh out silver will be eliminated.</p>
                <p>12 And it will come about at that time</p>
                <p>That I will search Jerusalem with lamps,</p>
                <p>And I will punish the people</p>
                <p>Who are stagnant in spirit,</p>
                <p>Who say in their hearts,</p>
                <p>‘The Lord will not do good nor harm!’</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                These are people who trust in the world instead of God. God will
                seek out those people and render his just judgment. You cannot
                escape God’s judgment.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>13 Their wealth will become plunder,</p>
                <p>And their houses desolate;</p>
                <p>Yes, they will build houses but not inhabit them,</p>
                <p>And plant vineyards but not drink their wine.”</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is super applicable to western culture. We work our whole
                lives for wealth and success yet we often die too early to enjoy
                it. We make money our idol.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>14 The great day of the Lord is near,</p>
                <p>Near and coming very quickly;</p>
                <p>Listen, the day of the Lord!</p>
                <p>In it the warrior cries out bitterly.</p>
                <p>15 That day is a day of anger,</p>
                <p>A day of trouble and distress,</p>
                <p>A day of destruction and desolation,</p>
                <p>A day of darkness and gloom,</p>
                <p>A day of clouds and thick darkness,</p>
                <p>16 A day of trumpet and battle cry</p>
                <p>Against the fortified cities</p>
                <p>And the high corner towers.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                For the Jews of the day judgment was upon them. Where God’s
                warriors would normally be seeing victory they will instead see
                defeat. Thousands of soldiers died during this siege, let alone
                the other battles that took place.
            </p>
            <p>
                I often forget about those who stood and fought, and died,
                defending God’s promised land. If you had a son who died,
                dealing with God’s judgment is no joke. How can the God you
                serve allow such evil to happen?! We are defending your house,
                your temple! Yet you let us be absolutely destroyed and killed.
            </p>
            <p>
                What about those who did heed this warning and repented, and yet
                still chose to fight knowing defeat was assured. I often try to
                project a black and white outlook when reading scripture, but
                the world is grey. God works in ways only he understands. Only
                he understands the justice in that. And he knows his people.
                Those who had faith in the coming messiah, and those who trust
                in Christ post resurrection.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>17 I will bring distress on mankind</p>
                <p>So that they will walk like those who are blind,</p>
                <p>Because they have sinned against the Lord;</p>
                <p>And their blood will be poured out like dust,</p>
                <p>And their flesh like dung.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We truly see God’s judgment in full force here. Almost no care
                for the death of these people. Sins result is truly terrifying.
                Sin is the ultimate evil and causes the ultimate destruction. It
                makes you wonder why God allowed sin to be a thing. Yet all I
                can see is his love. He allowed us to make the ultimate mistake,
                so we might be able to truly love God. Love without a choice is
                not really love. He allowed his prized creation to stumble so we
                could choose to stand with him. Sadly not all choose to stand
                up.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>18 Neither their silver nor their gold</p>
                <p>Will be able to save them</p>
                <p>On the day of the Lord’s anger;</p>
                <p>And all the earth will be devoured</p>
                <p>By the fire of His jealousy,</p>
                <p>For He will make a complete end,</p>
                <p>Indeed a horrifying one,</p>

            <p>
                So this is of course pointing to Christ's second coming. It
                probably felt like the world was ending to the jewsof the time.
                The absolute destruction of your people. The verse applies to us
                and them.
