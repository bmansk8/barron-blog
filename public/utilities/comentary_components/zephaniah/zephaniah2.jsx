                <p>1 Gather yourselves together, yes, join together,</p>
                <p>You nation without shame,</p>
                <p>2 Before the decree takes effect—</p>
                <p>The day passes like chaff—</p>
                <p>Before the burning anger of the Lord comes upon you,</p>
                <p>Before the day of the Lord’s anger comes upon you.</p>

            <p>
                God always allows for a time of repentance. There is always an
                opportunity to turn from sin and repent. God will never rob you
                of the opportunity to repent.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>3 Seek the Lord,</p>
                <p>All you humble of the earth</p>
                <p>Who have practiced His ordinances;</p>
                <p>Seek righteousness, seek humility.</p>
                <p>Perhaps you will remain hidden</p>
                <p>On the day of the Lord’s anger.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                If you are a righteous man, continue to be so. God will protect
                you. Even if you do get a taste of judgment, God will get you
                through it.

                <p>4 For Gaza will be abandoned,</p>
                <p>And Ashkelon will become a desolation;</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Ashdod will be driven out at noon,</p>
                <p>And Ekron will be uprooted.</p>
                <p>5 Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast,</p>
                <p>The nation of the Cherethites!</p>
                <p>The word of the Lord is against you,</p>
                <p>Canaan, land of the Philistines;</p>
                <p>And I will eliminate you</p>
                <p>So that there will be no inhabitant.</p>

            <p>
                These are all coastal cities. We see the Philistines and the
                Cherethites.. People are unsure who the Cherethites are.
                Regardless, Judah was shielding them from Babylon. But since
                Judah's fall was imminent they too would suffer. Judah’s
                failures didn’t just affect them. Even the surrounding people
                groups suffered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our sin affects those around us whether or not we want it to.
                Sin weaves its way into every aspect of life. No matter the sin,
                from pride to pornography. It hurts those around us.

                <p>6 So the seacoast will become grazing places,</p>
                <p>With pastures for shepherds and folds for flocks.</p>
                <p>7 And the coast will be</p>
                <p>For the remnant of the house of Judah,</p>
                <p>They will drive sheep to pasture on it.</p>
                <p>In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening;</p>
                <p>For the Lord their God will care for them</p>
                <p>And restore their fortunes.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I often find myself thinking that every jew was taken. The
                reality is many were left behind. God does not forget about
                those people either. God is using eminent domain on the sinful
                nations around Israel so that his remnant will be taken care of.
                He protects those who are brought into slavery, and those who
                are left behind.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>8 “I have heard the taunting of Moab</p>
                <p>And the abusive speech of the sons of Ammon,</p>
                <p>With which they have taunted My people</p>
                <p>And boasted against their territory.</p>
                <p>9 Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord of armies,</p>
                <p>The God of Israel,</p>
                <p>“Moab will assuredly be like Sodom,</p>
                <p>And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah—</p>
                <p>Ground overgrown with weeds and full of salt mines,</p>
                <p>And a permanent desolation.</p>
                <p>The remnant of My people will plunder them,</p>
                <p>And the remainder of My nation will inherit them.”</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is an interesting picture to me. The eastern front is
                falling apart. Babylon is marching forward. Yet the western
                front is full of victory for the jews. Only through God could a
                devastated nation continue to fight on the complete other side
                of their borders and have any kind of victory. These other
                nations probably wanted to pile on and kill some jews. That is
                not in God’s plan.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">

                    10 This they will have in return for their arrogance,
                    because they have taunted and boasted against the people of
                    the Lord of armies. 11 The Lord will be terrifying to them,
                    for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the
                    coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone
                    from his own place.

                God did not suddenly declare open season on the Judeans because
                they had stumbled. He was doing the punishing. And the other
                nations had some punishment coming their way to.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>12 “You also, Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword.”</p>
                <p>13 And He will stretch out His hand against the north</p>
                <p>And eliminate Assyria,</p>
                <p>And He will make Nineveh a desolation,</p>
                <p>Parched like the wilderness.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God is just clearing out this huge area. Just taking down
                every nation in sight. Even the almighty Assyria will be
                destroyed. The capital city is going to be sacked.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>14 Flocks will lie down in her midst,</p>
                <p>All animals that range in herds;</p>
                <p>Both the pelican and the hedgehog</p>
                <p>Will spend their nights in the tops of her pillars;</p>
                <p>Birds will sing in the window,</p>
                <p>Devastation will be on the threshold;</p>
                <p>For He has uncovered the cedar work.</p>
                <p>15 This is the presumptuous city</p>
                <p>That dwells securely,</p>
                <p>Who says in her heart,</p>
                <p>“I am, and there is no one besides me.”</p>
                <p>How she has become a desolation,</p>
                <p>A resting place for animals!</p>
                <p>Everyone who passes by her will hiss</p>
                <p>And wave his hand in contempt.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So Assyria’s capital will be nothing more than a place the
                animals chill out at. If you go anywhere abandoned there are
                always animals living there. And animals don’t really keep the
                place up do they? In fact it tends to do the opposite. The
                places often decay faster because of the animals living there.
            </p>

                The book of Nahum clues us into the deal with Nineveh. Even they
                are given a chance to repent. Of course it seems they do not
                because the city is indeed sacked and thousands die. Even the
                greatest city of the day could not escape God’s judgment.
