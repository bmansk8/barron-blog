                <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
                <p>1 Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled,</p>
                <p>The oppressive city!</p>
                <p>2 She obeyed no voice,</p>
                <p>She accepted no discipline.</p>
                <p>She did not trust in the Lord,</p>
                <p>She did not approach her God.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So she is referring to Jerusalem. It seems God had a particular
                issue with the people of his capital.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>3 Her leaders within her are roaring lions,</p>
                <p>Her judges are wolves at evening;</p>
                <p>They have no bones to gnaw in the morning.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So this is a little funky in the NASB but it means not even the
                bones are left in the morning. These people in power completely
                devour those under them.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>4 Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men;</p>
                <p>Her priests have profaned the sanctuary.</p>
                <p>They have done violence to the Law.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Even people that should be of God are treacherous. They are
                using the law to do violence.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>5 The Lord is righteous within her;</p>
                <p>He will do no injustice.</p>
                <p>Every morning He brings His justice to light;</p>
                <p>He does not fail.</p>
                <p>But the criminal knows no shame.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                God is just, but these men are like criminals. They have no
                shame for their wrong doing.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>6 “I have eliminated nations;</p>
                <p>Their corner towers are deserted.</p>
                <p>I have laid waste their streets,</p>
                <p>With no one passing by;</p>
                <p>Their cities have been laid waste,</p>
                <p>Without a person, without an inhabitant.</p>
                <p>7 I said, ‘You will certainly revere Me,</p>
                <p>You will accept discipline.’</p>
                <p>So her dwelling will not be eliminated</p>
                <p>
                    In accordance with everything that I have stipulated for
                    her.
                </p>
                <p>Instead, they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The Israelites have seen God’s mighty power. His ability to wipe
                out nations without a whisper. He told them to allow discipline
                so they might be saved, but they refused. They understood God’s
                power, God’s rules, and the punishment, yet they refused to
                repent. They chose sin over salvation.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>8 “Therefore wait for Me,” declares the Lord,</p>

                <p>Indeed, My decision is to gather nations,</p>
                <p>To assemble kingdoms,</p>
                <p>To pour out on them My indignation,</p>
                <p>All My burning anger;</p>
                <p>For all the earth will be devoured</p>
                <p>By the fire of My zeal.</p>
                <p>9 For then I will restore to the peoples pure lips,</p>
                <p>So that all of them may call on the name of the Lord,</p>
                <p>To serve Him shoulder to shoulder.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This of course is foretelling of the second coming of Christ.
                When judgment day is upon us. At that time sanctification will
                be complete. We will be made perfect so we can spend eternity
                with the perfect one.

            <div className="bible">
                <p>10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia</p>
                <p>My worshipers, My dispersed ones,</p>
                <p>Will bring My offerings.</p>

            <p>
                God once again points to his remnant. Those who are outside. The
                ones people forgot about in a far away land. This holds true for
                us as christians and jews. God cares about those who are far off
                and forgotten, jew or christian. God still has a plan for his
                nation. No matter where they are.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>12 But I will leave among you</p>
                <p>A humble and lowly people,</p>
                <p>And they will take refuge in the name of the Lord.</p>
                <p>13 The remnant of Israel will do no wrong</p>
                <p>And tell no lies,</p>
                <p>Nor will a deceitful tongue</p>
                <p>Be found in their mouths;</p>
                <p>For they will feed and lie down</p>
                <p>With no one to frighten them.”</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This statement is pretty true. Pretty much everything is taken
                over by babylon. Almost all the nations are defeated. Little is
                understood about this remnant but one might guess they would not
                forget this monumental act of God.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course in the perspective of eternity this also makes sense.
                Those jews who believe in Christ upon his second coming.

                <p>14 Shout for joy, daughter of Zion!</p>
                <p>Shout in triumph, Israel!</p>
                <p>Rejoice and triumph with all your heart,</p>
                <p>Daughter of Jerusalem!</p>

                <p>The King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst;</p>
                <p>You will no longer fear disaster.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Because of Christ we don’t have to suffer God’s wrath. We are
                absolved of all sin. We will be with God for eternity. Dwelling
                with God just as Adam and Eve did.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>16 On that day it will be said to Jerusalem:</p>
                <p>“Do not be afraid, Zion;</p>
                <p>Do not let your hands fall limp.</p>
                <p>17 The Lord your God is in your midst,</p>
                <p>A victorious warrior.</p>
                <p>He will rejoice over you with joy,</p>
                <p>He will be quiet in His love,</p>
                <p>He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                These "he will"s are against the "she did not"s in the beginning
                of this chapter. She did trust God, she did not approach God,
                she had no discipline, she did not listen to any wise voice. But
                we see God is a victorious warrior. He will rejoice, show love,
                and will rejoice.
            </p>
            <p>
                One might see the center of God’s rejoicing is his quiet love. A
                better translation would be that he will quiet you with his
                love. He will carve his love into you. It will become a part of
                you. And all your cries of pain and hurt will be silenced. God’s
                love heals all wounds.

                God knows some people will be frustrated that Israel failed to
                repent. This exile is a huge failure on their part. God will not
                forget those either. Those who mourn the failures of the past.

                Oddly enough the original NASB does a little better job to me in
                the translation. I would highly encourage looking at a few
                translations to get a good idea of this verse. It is somewhat
                tricky to translate.

                God will punish those who make others suffer. He will lift up

                suffering of others.

                God promises restoration. His people will never be forgotten.
                These promises are by no means fulfilled today, but they will be
                some day. God keeps his promises. Whether it’s bad, like the
                destruction of nations or the judgment of his people. Or the
                promise of restoration and salvation.
