                So because of the unknown date of authorship I think about how
                this applies to me. Christ return is the obvious connection. We
                must always be ready because we are always a day closer to his
                return.

            <p>
                The level of complete destruction is absolute here. Verse 3 is
                interesting also because it supports the creation story.
                Everything God created is good, and the destruction this army
                causes is inescapable. There are many alogories to me. One is
                that God’s judgment cannot be avoided. It is inescapable.
                Another is that we are now in a world of sin. We cannot avoid
                sin until Christ returns. It is always destroying and desolating
                everything it touches.

                This force, whether the armies of Assyria or Babylon, or
                something metaphorical, is elite. Well trained and focused on
                one goal. Our enemy, aka the devil, is this way with his legions
                of angels. He seeks only destruction and death.

            <p>
                We see here the Lord is the head of this army. This points to
                both Christ's return, and his use of Assyria and Baylon to
                correct the jewish people. Joal asks the question, who can
                endure it? Without Christ the answer is no one. Just like we
                believe in Christ today, the jews believed in the coming
                messiah. That is how they continued, and we continue to make it
                through this sin filled world.

                God wants us, and the jews of Joal’s day, to return to him. To

                God is after the heart. Jesus’ teachings harp on this a ton.
                Also remember God is long suffering so none might parish. He is
                eager for your return to him. He is slow to be angry and full of
                love. He doesn’t want you to feel his wrath.

                </a>
                . If Joel is post Jonah, he is pointing out that gentiles
                repented, so why can’t us jews do the same. This also calls to
                the idea that God is willing to spare people his wrath. Jonah
                was assured God would spare Nineveh if they repented. Thus why
                he didn’t want to go. God simply asks that you come to him in
                repentance. Give God your heart and he will give you his
                unending grace.

                Get everyone involved in this time of repentance. Even the bride
                and bridegroom should leave their places to participate. Nothing
                should stop you from doing this. The priest must pray for

                        Spare Your people, O LORD, and do not give Your heritage
                        to reproach
                    </strong>
                    : Joel puts a rich prayer of repentance into the mouths of
                    God’s priests. It is as if the priests should pray with the
                    thought, “How can we persuade God to have mercy on us?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. <strong>Spare</strong>: This implies that God’s people
                    deserve judgment, but they plead for mercy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. <strong>Your people</strong>: This reminds God that they
                    belong to Him and provides another motivation for mercy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iii. <strong>Do not give Your heritage to reproach</strong>:
                    This tells God that mercy unto His people will bring Him
                    glory among the nations and that judgment may bring His name
                    into discredit.

            <p>
                So I’m unsure if this warning was headed. Because of Joel’s
                unknown date of authorship, let's think of Joel telling the
                future. If you repent this is what God will do.

                <p>18 Then the Lord was jealous for his land</p>

            <p>
                God is yearning for our repentance so he might be able to bless
                us.

            <p>
                God promises with repentance that he will then turn his wrath on
                the army. Note this army is the one God was using to discipline
                Judah. He will not continue to punish you once repentance is
                reached. God is using restorative justice. Once things are made
                right, the punishing action is over.

                <p>because he is faithful.</p>
                <p>He sends you abundant showers,</p>

            </div>

            <p>
                So God is promising blessings. Repentance does not lead to
                continued suffering. It leads to God’s blessings. Just as he
                takes care of the animals, he also takes care of his people.

            <p>
                This is an interesting set of verses to me. Number one God’s
                promises to repay us for our suffering. As Christians we get
                eternal life and riches in heaven. Pretty good deal if you ask
                me.
            </p>
            <p>
                But is also saying that his people will never again be shamed.
                That they will know God is in Israel and he is their Lord. He
                says “never again will my people be shamed” twice. So if this is
                early authorship, Judah does repent. But they later fail to
                repent again and get destroyed. If it is after the sacking of
                the northern kingdom, why did they fail to repent this time?
                Only to fall to Babylon. If it is during the exile or upon the
                return, how can this statement be true? The jews do get shamed
                later in life. Many atrocities come their way and of course the
                third destruction of the temple by Rome. Basically God’s
                presence leaving the jews.
            </p>
            <p>
                This leads to a dangerous idea that we as Christians replace the
                jews and Israel. This idea of replacement theology has many
                flaws. God still has his role for his people. Yes we were
                adopted into the line of Abraham according to Paul. But we do
                not replace the jews. There are still promises there to be
                fulfilled. The fact the jews are still around means verses like
                this are yet to be fulfilled. At some point once again God will
                be in Israel. His people will never again be shamed.

                <p>I will pour out my Spirit on all people.</p>
                <p>Your sons and daughters will prophesy,</p>
                <p>your old men will dream dreams,</p>

                <p>29 Even on my servants, both men and women,</p>
                <p>I will pour out my Spirit in those days.</p>

            <p>
                Obviously we as Christians see this as the holy spirit. The holy
                spirit is a gift to all believers. We are all indwelt by the
                spirit. Of course there is much debate on the specifics, but I
                will avoid that here.

                The jews suffering doesn’t last forever. They call on God and
                return to the promised land. The survivors experience
                deliverance. As Christians we know anyone can be saved from
                God’s judgment. Repentance with a truthful heart always leads to
                salvation. Anyone who calls on God will be saved. He wants to
                save everyone. Sadly not everyone will accept his offer.
