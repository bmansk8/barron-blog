                <p>1 The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Pethuel.</p>
                <p>2 Hear this, you elders;</p>
                <p>listen, all who live in the land.</p>
                <p>Has anything like this ever happened in your days</p>
                <p>or in the days of your ancestors?</p>
                <p>3 Tell it to your children,</p>
                <p>and let your children tell it to their children,</p>
                <p>and their children to the next generation.</p>
                <p>4 What the locust swarm has left</p>
                <p>the great locusts have eaten;</p>
                <p>what the great locusts have left</p>
                <p>the young locusts have eaten;</p>
                <p>what the young locusts have left</p>
                <p>other locusts have eaten.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So Joel opens with the idea that they should never forget what
                the locusts have brought. To add even more hot debate, the 4
                words for the locusts in this section are also argued about.
                Whatever they meant, locust, horses, armies or whatever, we are
                called to remember the devastation they caused.

            <div className="bible">
                <p>5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!</p>
                <p>Wail, all you drinkers of wine;</p>
                <p>wail because of the new wine,</p>
                <p>for it has been snatched from your lips.</p>
                <p>6 A nation has invaded my land,</p>
                <p>a mighty army without number;</p>
                <p>it has the teeth of a lion,</p>
                <p>the fangs of a lioness.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The time of party and rest is over. The army has come and
                invaded the land. A lion’s teeth are scary, and a lioness does
                most of the killing. So these soldiers have done their fair
                share of killing.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>7 It has laid waste my vines</p>
                <p>and ruined my fig trees.</p>
                <p>It has stripped off their bark</p>
                <p>and thrown it away,</p>
                <p>leaving their branches white.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So the vines and fig trees are the Lords. Yet the invading
                nation ruined them. A fig tree's branches becoming white can
                mean dormancy or a fungal infection. Either way there is no more
                fruit to be had. A fig tree and vine are often used together.
                There is no drink or food. There is nothing.

            <div className="bible">
                <p>8 Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth</p>
                <p>grieving for the betrothed of her youth.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The sadness of a woman who lost her fiance is strong. A deep
                painful mourning. They are called to mourn all the devastation.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>9 Grain offerings and drink offerings</p>
                <p>are cut off from the house of the Lord.</p>
                <p>The priests are in mourning,</p>
                <p>those who minister before the Lord.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                They are unable to worship the Lord. Being separated from God is
                an extremely heavy burden.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>10 The fields are ruined,</p>
                <p>the ground is dried up;</p>
                <p>the grain is destroyed,</p>
                <p>the new wine is dried up,</p>
                <p>the olive oil fails.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                There is no land to plant new food or drink, and the food and
                drink they had is gone. The oil failing is really concerning. It
                was often used to anoint someone. The anointing oil is not even
                working.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>11 Despair, you farmers,</p>

                <p>because the harvest of the field is destroyed.</p>
                <p>12 The vine is dried up</p>
                <p>and the fig tree is withered;</p>
                <p>the pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree—</p>
                <p>all the trees of the field—are dried up.</p>
                <p>Surely the people’s joy</p>
                <p>is withered away.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Everything is gone and those who are suffering should be
                mourning.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>13 Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn;</p>
                <p>wail, you who minister before the altar.</p>
                <p>Come, spend the night in sackcloth,</p>
                <p>you who minister before my God;</p>
                <p>for the grain offerings and drink offerings</p>
                <p>are withheld from the house of your God.</p>
                <p>The priests are being called to mourn.</p>

                <p>and all who live in the land</p>
                <p>to the house of the Lordyour God,</p>
                <p>and cry out to the Lord.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                They are to call people to fast. To cry out to God for
                salvation. For God to save them.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Of course as Christains we think of Jesus' second coming. For
                the people of Joel’s time it was probably far more literal. And
                it was on its way.

            <p>
                There is literally no food. Not even any scraps for the animals.
                Sheep and cows can live off of grass. Yet there is not even any
                grass for them to eat.

            <p>
                There is complete devastation, so we must call on the Lord. he
                is our only salvation in times of great suffering.
