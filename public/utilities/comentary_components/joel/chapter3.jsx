                <p>1 “In those days and at that time,</p>
                <p>when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
                <p>2 I will gather all nations</p>
                <p>and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.</p>
                <p>There I will put them on trial</p>
                <p>for what they did to my inheritance, my people Israel,</p>
                <p>because they scattered my people among the nations</p>
                <p>and divided up my land.</p>
                <p>3 They cast lots for my people</p>
                <p>and traded boys for prostitutes;</p>
                <p>they sold girls for wine to drink.</p>

            <p>
                So God promises the evil these other nations commit will be
                judged. God may allow you to experience some injustice. Maybe
                you come closer to him or you learn a valuable lesson. Maybe for
                no reason at all. Life happens. But all injustice will be judged
                upon Christ's return.

                    regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I
                    have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and
                    speedily return on your own heads what you have done. 5 For
                    you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest
                    treasures to your temples.

            <p>
                God does not tolerate his people's suffering. God takes care of
                his own.

                    you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you
                    have done. 8 I will sell your sons and daughters to the

                So all the evil these nations have caused to the jews will
                happen to them also. This is the same people group the queen of
                Sheba comes from.

            <p>
                God will be killing them in droves is what it sounds like to me.
                Like a sickle with hay or trampling grapes.

            <p>
                So God’s judgment will be violent. He will be showing off his
                power. Yet for his people, he is a refuge. As{' '}

                So the above verses are hard to understand in any context. The
                jews are <em>still</em> suffering under foreign powers. Us as
                Christains simply look to Christ return. But for the jews how
                does this apply? Maybe something to think on is every nation
                that has opposed Israel has at some point met its end. Often in
                pretty nasty ways. Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Rome, the Muslim
                crusades, Nazi germany, and the <em>many</em> arab invasions of
                the 20th century. While this promise might not be fully complete
                in the eternal sense, it still rings true to today. God still
                protects his nation.

                <p>17 “Then you will know that I, the Lord your God,</p>

                <p>Jerusalem will be holy;</p>
                <p>never again will foreigners invade her.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The day when this promise is eternally complete will be a great
                one.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>18 “In that day the mountains will drip new wine,</p>
                <p>and the hills will flow with milk;</p>
                <p>all the ravines of Judah will run with water.</p>
                <p>A fountain will flow out of the Lord’s house</p>

                    God is promising great blessings. An abundance of
                    everything.

                <p>19 But Egypt will be desolate,</p>
                <p>Edom a desert waste,</p>
                <p>because of violence done to the people of Judah,</p>
                <p>in whose land they shed innocent blood.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Now is this a literal Egypt and Edom? Maybe, maybe not. Either
                way it is a contrast to the blessings of the Lord reserved for
                his people. Those who oppose him will be ruined and destroyed.
