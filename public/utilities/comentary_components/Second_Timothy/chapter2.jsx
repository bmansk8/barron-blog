                <p>
                    1 You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
                    Jesus.

            </div>

            <p>
                So Paul shows his love for Timothy in this verse. Paul calls him
                his own son. One can only imagine how close these two were for
                Paul to call him his son.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    2 And the things you have heard me say in the presence of
                    many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be
                    qualified to teach others.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Paul is encouraging Timothy to spread Paul's teachings. He also
                points out that he has said these things in front of witnesses.
                This means they are trustworthy. It also helps keep them true
                because many have heard them instead of one. They should be
                passed onto the next group of trustworthy teachers.

            <h3>Talking point</h3>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    3 Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ
                    Jesus. 4 No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in
                    civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding
                    officer. 5 Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does
                    not receive the victor’s crown except by competing according
                    to the rules. 6 The hardworking farmer should be the first
                    to receive a share of the crops. 7 Reflect on what I am
                    saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We see Paul wants Timothy to think on this. Let's do the same.
                First the soldier.
            </p>
            <p>
                The soldier seems pretty obvious. We should not get distracted
                by the things of this world. We are soldiers of the kingdom. We
                are only to care about the Lord's work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second is the athlete. You only receive a crown by competing,
                and competing by the rules. There is no cheating God. we must
                follow his commands. I think with the previous verse in mind we
                see suffering as a part of it. We must all suffer for Christ at
                some point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the farmer should be first to receive a share of the
                crops. The parable of the sower comes to mind.{' '}
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+4&version=NIV">
                    Mark 4
                </a>{' '}
                and{' '}
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13&version=NIV">
                    Matthew 13
                </a>{' '}
                clue us in. We see that God is the sower in this story. So God
                deserves the first share of the crops. But why does God need the
                first share of crops? Does he not get all the shares? One could
                say the crop is all the people saved by Christ blood. Of course
                God wants these people. Of course God wants our first fruits.
                Our tithe. Whether it be money or time. The fruits of our labor.
            </p>
            <p>
                It could simply be that Paul is telling Timothy to work hard so
                he might receive great rewards in heaven.{' '}
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+5%3A7-8&version=NIV">
                    James 5:7-8
                </a>{' '}
                would suggest this idea. We don’t know when the Lord is coming
                but we are eagerly awaiting our valuable crop. Our rewards in
                heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                This idea for verse 6 really depends on who you think the farmer
                is. Of course we see Paul understands that there is truth hidden
                here. Thus why he tells Timothy to dwell on it. He wants Timothy
                to experience Sod. That insight that only comes From God
                revealing truth to you.

                    8 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended
                    from David. This is my gospel, 9 for which I am suffering
                    even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But
                    God’s word is not chained. 10 Therefore I endure everything
                    for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the
                    salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We see that Jesus and his resurrection is crucial. That is the
                gospel Paul has preached, and it is the true gospel. It’s also
                why he is suffering. God’s word is not chained though. It
                continues to spread because of people like Timothy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elect here is an odd word choice. In greek it generally refers
                to the hebrews. Paul still has so much love for his jewish
                brothers. He longs for them to be saved as he is.

            <p>
                We then see a classic Paul move. We see this saying used 3 times
                in 1 Timothy and in his letter to Titus. Paul is stating the
                fact that this saying is to be fully accepted to reference{' '}

            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>11 Here is a trustworthy saying:</p>
                <p>If we died with him,</p>
                <p>we will also live with him;</p>
                <p>12 if we endure,</p>
                <p>we will also reign with him.</p>
                <p>If we disown him,</p>
                <p>he will also disown us;</p>
                <p>13 if we are faithless,</p>
                <p>he remains faithful,</p>
                <p>for he cannot disown himself.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So we see some pretty obvious things. We must die with Christ as
                he died so we might live with him in eternity. We must endure
                just as Christ endured for us. If we disown God he will also
                disown us. But the ending is so amazing. If we are faithless,
                Christ is also faithless. Wait.. no! Christ remains faithful.
                God never loses faith. God will always be faithful even when we
                are not. He will never revoke his offer of salvation. He will
                never lose faith in us! As long as we remain in Christ, Christ
                remains in us. He will never lose faith in us. Even when we
                struggle with keeping the faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul then jumps into how Timothy can deal with false teachers.

                    will become more and more ungodly. 17 Their teaching will
                    spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
                    18 who have departed from the truth. They say that the
                    resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the

            <p>
                We see here an example of some people participating in godless
                chatter. The greek here literally means gangrene. Gangrene is a
                nasty skin disease. Generally it happens on the hands and feet
                of a person because of a lack of blood to the area. These people
                lack the blood of Christ in their lives. They are also causing
                others to lose their faith. They are actively leading some
                astray. They are causing the body of Christ to die. Paul did
                this before converting over. He caused people to turn away from
                the faith. He knows first hand this evil.
