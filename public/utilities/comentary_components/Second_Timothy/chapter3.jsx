                    1 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last
                    days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of
                    money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their
                    parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving,
                    slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the
                    good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure
                    rather than lovers of God— 5 having a form of godliness but
                    denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.

                So Paul tells us even 2000 years ago we would encounter people
                like this. One thing is that before we started following Christ
                we also probably had some if not all of these traits. Even as
                Christ followers we struggle with these things. Verse 5 is
                interesting to me. Having a form of godliness but denying its
                power. What does that mean? All the other verses are easy enough
                to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul seems to be thinking about this idea of godliness a lot. He
                mentions it 6 times in 1st Timothy.{' '}
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+3%3A16&version=NIV">
                    1st Timothy 3:16
                </a>{' '}
                gives us a clue.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    16 Beyond all question, the mystery from which true
                    godliness springs is great:
                </p>
                <p>He appeared in the flesh,</p>
                <p>was vindicated by the Spirit,</p>
                <p>was seen by angels,</p>
                <p>was preached among the nations,</p>
                <p>was believed on in the world,</p>
                <p>was taken up in glory.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We also see in the greek this word can mean piety or devotion.
                Piety is defined as “the quality of being religious or
                reverent”. So it seems some people have devotion for God but
                deny its power. True godliness comes from Christ and not
                religious fervour or some mis-guided devotion.

                    6 They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain

                    and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, 7 always

                We see these kinds of men prey on women who are also full of
                sin. They seem to always be learning but not learning the truth.
                That truth being Christ.

                    8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these
                    teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds,
                    who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.

                These are the two names for the magicians in Exodus 7. Oddly
                enough these names are only here in Timothy. They are not
                included in Exodus. I will link to an
                <em>amazing</em> article I found on the subject that also
                tackles some other important issues. Namely if these names don’t
                come from the bible does that affect the believability of the
                bible?

                    9 But they will not get very far because, as in the case of
                    those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.

                So we see anyone with discernment will see through these men and
                their lies. Their stupidity will be evident. This also means we
                can test people to see if they are true. Their folly will become
                clear to us.

                Oddly with a whole chapter left Paul begins his final charge to
                Timothy.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    10 You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life,
                    my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 11
                    persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me
                    in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured.
                    Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Paul is reminding Timothy of all his sufferings. Yet he says God
                rescued him from all of them. Of course whether that is
                physically or spiritually in death. This should be a{' '}
                <em>strong</em> encouragement to any believer.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    12 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in
                    Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 13 while evildoers and
                    impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being
                    deceived.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Honestly I resonate so much with this verse. Christianity is
                often portrayed as some flower walk with God full of health and
                wealth. Paul combats this idea. If you follow Christ{' '}
                <em>you will be persecuted. </em>That is a fact. Yet we see that
                evildoers will simply only get worse. They are deceiving and
                being deceived.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and
                    have become convinced of, because you know those from whom
                    you learned it, 15 and how from infancy you have known the
                    Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for
                    salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So we see even though Timothy had a greek father, his jewish
                mother instilled the scriptures in him. This also means the old
                testament is of value to us now. They make us wise.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching,
                    rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17 so
                    that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every
                    good work.

            </div>

            <p>
                Of course the famous verse 16 is the end all be all. But wait…
                was Paul also referring to his own letters? What about the
                gospels and the book of James? What about Luke's gospel? What
                about the book of Acts? Paul dies before any of Peter or John’s
                stuff is even written.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think if we are honest he is referring to the old testament in
                this particular case. I think this also tells us how much the
                Old Testament matters to the modern day reader.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of note is that Paul in{' '}

                Peter refers to Paul's letters as having “the wisdom that God
                gave him”. Inspired word from God aka scripture.{' '}

                also seems to suggest this idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                To end this note. I don’t think in this direct case Paul is
                talking specifically about his letters and other new testament
                scripture. I do believe Paul, the other apostles, and new
                testament writers do seem to understand that what they are
                writing is inspired and should be considered scripture.
