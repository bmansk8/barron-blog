                <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
                <p>
                    1 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge
                    the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and
                    his kingdom, I give you this charge:
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I’m going to state the charge in one whole go then talk about it
                in sections.

                    2 Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season;
                    correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and
                    careful instruction. 3 For the time will come when people
                    will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their
                    own desires, they will gather around them a great number of
                    teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They
                    will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to
                    myths. 5 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure
                    hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the
                    duties of your ministry.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Verse 2. We are to preach the word in and out of season. What
                does that mean? To me that would mean whether we are in a church
                or out and about. Whether we are preaching on purpose, or the
                occasion arises where we must witness. At all times we must be
                prepared to preach the word. We are to rebuke, correct, and
                encourage with patience and careful instruction at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verse 3,4. Paul warns us that some people will seek out only
                what they want to hear. They don’t want to be convicted. They
                still love areas of their life and are not willing to give it up
                to Christ. We also understand people will be willing to teach
                these false doctrines. Their ears itch for truth, but they fill
                them with false teaching instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verse 5. Timothy must “keep his head” in all situations. The
                greek here means to be sober. Do not be under the influence of
                anything. Endure the hardships that come with following Jesus.
                Do the work of the evangelist. The greek here means a bringer of
                good news. Someone who tells others of Christ and his
                euangelion. Do all your godly duties!

                    6 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering,
                    and the time for my departure is near. 7 I have fought the
                    good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.

            </div>

            <p>
                We see next that Paul is already experiencing death. He has
                labored and fought hard in his years of ministry. Over 30 years
                of faithful ministry. He has finished the race and kept the
                faith. He knows death is knocking on his door.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    8 Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness,
                    which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on
                    that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed
                    for his appearing.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Paul lets us know our reward is in heaven. A crown of
                righteousness, something worth looking forward to. This is for
                all who follow Christ.
            </p>
            <p>Paul then gets a little personal.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    9 Do your best to come to me quickly, 10 for Demas, because
                    he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to
                    Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to
                    Dalmatia. 11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him
                    with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We see Paul is alone. Deserted by his friends except for Luke.
                Imagine being close to death and the People who served with you
                desert you! Only one person stays with you. We do see that Luke
                is a true friend and follower of Christ because he stays with
                Paul. Paul asking Timothy to bring Mark also known as John-Mark
                shows he seems to have sorted out his issues with him from acts.
                Let us not forget Mark deserted Paul earlier. So even those who
                have deserted Paul through the work of Christ can mature.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>12 I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We see the only other person apparently who would have stayed
                with Paul. Paul sent him to do the work of Christ in Ephesus.
                Probably with tears in his eyes to see a friend go. But also
                filled with joy knowing God had a plan to use him.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at
                    Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Honestly this makes my heart break. Paul is so low he simply
                wants his coak so he might be warm. Just bring some of my
                scrolls and parchments so I might have something to read as I
                prepare to die.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">

                    14 Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm.
                    The Lord will repay him for what he has done. 15 You too
                    should be on your guard against him, because he strongly
                    opposed our message.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is most likely the guy who got Paul imprisoned the second
                time. Much debate on how and where Paul is put in prison again
                but this man is probably the main cause. He might have also
                testified against Paul in Rome but the way it’s written Timothy
                seems to know who this is. It also is far to suggest Timothy
                will encounter him based on Paul's warning to Timothy. Of course
                it may just be some guy in Ephesus. Timothy being the pastor
                should be aware of him.

                    16 At my first defense, no one came to my support, but
                    everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. 17
                    But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that
                    through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the
                    Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion’s
                    mouth.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So Paul is completely deserted at his first hearing. I would
                assume Luke and Tychicus were not yet with Paul. Paul, like
                Christ on the cross, still has grace for these men. Paul is
                probably thinking of John-Mark and how he has matured in Christ.
                God still backs up Paul though. The message was preached, and
                that is a win in Paul's book.

                    ever and ever. Amen.

            </div>

            <p>
                We see Paul knows death awaits him. Nero is ready to kill him.
                But that is a rescue in Paul's eyes. Using the NLT from{' '}

                    the Lord.

            </div>

            <p>
                Paul wrote this years earlier, but he does truly believe it.
                It’s something that is a good thing, not a bad thing.
            </p>
            <p>We then get his final greetings.</p>

            </div>

            <p>
                So Paul is doing some general housekeeping. Things Timothy
                should know before his death.

            </div>

            <p>
                These people might simply be the believers in Rome. Paul's main
                group have left him but they are still here. From previous
                verses we gather they are not with Paul anymore. I lean more
                towards these being people who knew Timothy and when Paul
                encountered them they told Paul to wish Timothy well.

            </p>
            <p>
                Spirit can be translated this way. This is an interesting way to
                translate it for sure. While maybe not the dominant translation,
                I think it is worth pondering.
