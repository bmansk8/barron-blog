                <p>
                    1 See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we
                    should be called children of God! And that is what we are!
                    The reason the world does not know us is that it did not
                    know him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and
                    what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know
                    that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall
                    see him as he is.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We are children of God! That is something to be encouraged by.
                The world does not understand that that means but we do. When
                Jesus comes back and we receive our perfect bodies for eternity
                that is something to look forward to.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    3 All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as
                    he is pure. 4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin
                    is lawlessness.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We are to purify ourselves just as Christ is pure. When we sin
                we break the law. Sin is living without the old testament law.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    5 You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and
                    in Him there is no sin. 6 No one who remains in Him sins
                    continually; no one who sins continually has seen Him or
                    knows Him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So anyone who truly has come to Christ will strive to sin no
                longer. Sure, we all sin sometimes, but not all the time.
                Repentance is seeing your sin, turning around, and walking the
                other way
            </p>

            <div className="bible">

                    7 Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one
                    who does what is right is righteous, just as he is
                    righteous.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Actions will tell you if someone is a follower of Christ. Do not
                be led astray by people who sin, yet claim to be a brother.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    8 The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because
                    the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason
                    the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                People who sin belong to the devil. Christ came to destroy sin
                and the devil.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    9 No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because
                    God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning,
                    because they have been born of God. 10 This is how we know
                    who the children of God are and who the children of the
                    devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s
                    child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and
                    sister.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Any one reborn into Christ will not continue to sin because God
                is in them. This is how we know who are our true brothers and
                sisters in Christ. John also throws in that those who have no
                love are also not of Christ. Just not sinning is not enough, we
                must also have love for one another.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    11 For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We
                    should love one another.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John is now hitting us with the “message” again. This is now the
                third time. Everything he is talking about is all a part of the
                one message. John is simply reiterating something they have
                already heard and should know.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">

                    12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and
                    murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his
                    own actions were evil and his brother’s were righteous. 13
                    Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world
                    hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to
                    life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love
                    remains in death. 15 Anyone who hates a brother or sister is
                    a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life
                    residing in him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is strong language coming from John. If we hate one another
                it is as if we have killed them. Having no love is not God’s
                way.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">

                <p>
                    16 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down
                    his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our
                    brothers and sisters. 17 If anyone has material possessions
                    and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on
                    them, how can the love of God be in that person? 18 Dear
                    children, let us not love with words or speech but with
                    actions and in truth.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Simply saying you have love for someone is not enough. Action is
                needed. Show people that you have love. <em>Show them</em>{' '}
                Christ's love in you. Don’t just say it and leave it at that.

                    19 This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how
                    we set our hearts at rest in his presence:
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John is telling us how we know we are christians and belong to
                the truth, or Christ. The way, the truth, the life John 14:6.

                    20 If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater
                    than our hearts, and he knows everything.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                God is in us convicting us. He is in our heart telling us when
                we are in the wrong.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have
                    confidence before God 22 and receive from him anything we
                    ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                If our hearts, under the control of God, don’t convict us, we
                can go before God knowing whatever we ask is within his will and
                we will receive it.

                    23 And this is his command: to believe in the name of his
                    Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded
                    us. 24 The one who keeps God’s commands lives in him, and he
                    in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We
                    know it by the Spirit he gave us.

            <p>
                John solidly ends this thought process. First actions confirm
                these things, then also the spirit within us. John then in the
                next chapter tackles how we know if the spirit is trustworthy.
