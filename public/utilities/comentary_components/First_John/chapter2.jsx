                <p>
                    1 My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not
                    sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the
                    Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning
                    sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for
                    the sins of the whole world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John rightly also reminds us if we do sin, and we probably will,
                Christ has intervened on our behalf. For everyone who was is and
                will be on this earth. John continues.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    3 We know that we have come to know him if we keep his
                    commands. 4 Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what
                    he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.
                    5 But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made
                    complete in them. This is how we know we are in him: 6
                    Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.

            </div>

            <p>
                John here is hitting on the teachings of the book of James and
                Paul’s teachings. John probably read James' book as they both
                were pillars in the Jerusalem church. Thus the idea of faith
                without works is dead. Of course Paul wrote many letters and
                these would have been known by this point in history. Paul is
                always pushing to live like Christ. This was written post James,
                and Paul's death. John is reaffirming these teachings to be
                true. Don’t stop following these teachings for something new.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an
                    old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old
                    command is the message you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing
                    you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you,
                    because the darkness is passing and the true light is
                    already shining.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is nothing new. Even before James and Paul Jesus taught
                these things. John is seemingly stating these are not new
                believers. They know the truth, yet they are not following it.
                John then states this new command.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    9 Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother
                    or sister is still in the darkness. 10 Anyone who loves
                    their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is
                    nothing in them to make them stumble. 11 But anyone who
                    hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks
                    around in the darkness. They do not know where they are
                    going, because the darkness has blinded them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So if you live in the light you practice love. Living in the
                darkness is void of love. If you live in darkness you don't know
                where you are going. You are blinded by the darkness. Jesus is
                the light, touching back to chapter 1 verse 5. Darkness is
                passing, live in the light as verse 8 states.
            </p>
            <p>
                So John here explains why he is writing. Seemingly to
                established christians.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>12 I am writing to you, dear children,</p>
                <p>
                    because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
                </p>
                <p>13 I am writing to you, fathers,</p>
                <p>because you know him who is from the beginning.</p>
                <p>I am writing to you, young men,</p>
                <p>because you have overcome the evil one.</p>
                <p>14 I write to you, dear children,</p>
                <p>because you know the Father.</p>
                <p>I write to you, fathers,</p>
                <p>because you know him who is from the beginning.</p>
                <p>I write to you, young men,</p>
                <p>because you are strong,</p>
                <p>and the word of God lives in you,</p>
                <p>and you have overcome the evil one.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So both of these sections are almost verbatim the same. John
                here is trying to tell us something.
            </p>
            <p>First off the children.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    John first states they are forgiven because of Jesus' name.
                </li>
                <li>He then reiterates this by saying they know the father.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Two different greek words are used for children here.</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/teknia_5040.htm">
                    Greek Concordance: Τεκνία (Teknia) -- 8 Occurrences
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/paidia_3813.htm">
                    Greek Concordance: παιδία (paidia) -- 13 Occurrences
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The first one is used a lot more in John and is first in this
                section. Teknia is generally a kind way for a teacher to refer
                to his disciples
            </p>
            <p>Paidia is more so to an actual child. A small boy or girl.</p>
            <p>
                Oddly the reason for writing to the fathers is the same in both.
                Simply because they know Christ (I say Christ because john’s
                gospel emphasizes Christ was also there in the beginning so one
                could assume that continues here (although God or Christ I
                suppose are interchangeable))
            </p>
            <p>The greek word is the same</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/pateres_3962.htm">
                    Greek Concordance: πατέρες (pateres) -- 24 Occurrences
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>Then the sons</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First because the have overcome the evil one</li>
                <li>Then because they are</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Strong</li>
                    <li>The word lives in them</li>
                    <li>They have overcome the evil one (written again)</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <p>The same greek word is also used for both young men</p>
            <p>

                </a>
            </p>
            <p>Moving on,</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    15 Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone
                    loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. 16 For
                    everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of
                    the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father
                    but from the world. 17 The world and its desires pass away,
                    but whoever does the will of God lives forever.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We may be a part of this world but if we love the things of this
                world then we can’t also love Jesus.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    Matthew 6:24 "No one can serve two masters. Either you will
                    hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to
                    the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and
                    money.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John is reiterating this teaching of Jesus here again. The
                reason we should not love the world? Because earthly things are
                fleeting. They will pass away. Another teaching of Jesus
                referenced here.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    Luke 12:33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor.
                    Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a
                    treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief
                    comes near and no moth destroys.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>John then moves on.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    18 Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have
                    heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many
                    antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last
                    hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not really
                    belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would
                    have remained with us; but their going showed that none of
                    them belonged to us.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John equates these false believers to be just like the
                antichrist. Truly bold words.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of
                    you know the truth. 21 I do not write to you because you do
                    not know the truth, but because you do know it and because
                    no lie comes from the truth.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John again seems to be talking to established believers. People
                who know the truth. There can be no lies in truth.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    22 Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the
                    Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father
                    and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father;
                    whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Once again John is using strong verbiage here. So what are we to
                do? Well John tells us.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    24 As for you, see that what you have heard from the
                    beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain
                    in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what he
                    promised us—eternal life.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We must keep what we know is truth. This also applies to us with
                the bible. Anyone trying to add to it, or preaching anything
                counter to it is lying.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    26 I am writing these things to you about those who are
                    trying to lead you astray. 27 As for you, the anointing you
                    received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone
                    to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all
                    things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just
                    as it has taught you, remain in him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We don’t need anything extra, we have all that we need. God’s
                anointing aka the spirit teaches us, guides us. It is real,
                remain in it.
            </p>
