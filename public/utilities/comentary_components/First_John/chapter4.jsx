                    1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the
                    spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false
                    prophets have gone out into the world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The greek word here means spirit, wind, or breath. John is
                saying test the breaths, the spirits, of these people. Many
                false prophets breathe, aka speak, lies. Their spirit does not
                reflect Christ.

                    Strong's Greek: 4151. πνεῦμα (pneuma) -- wind, spirit

                    2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every
                    spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the
                    flesh is from God, 3 but every spirit that does not
                    acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the
                    antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is
                    already in the world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Little exercise here is to replace spirit with breath.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    2 This is how you can recognize the <em>breath</em> of God:
                    Every <em>breath</em> that acknowledges that Jesus Christ
                    has come in the flesh is from God, 3 but every{' '}
                    <em>breath</em> that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from
                    God. This is the <em>breath</em> of the antichrist, which
                    you have heard is coming and even now is already in the
                    world.

            <p>
                Of course we know satan does not want to acknowledge Christ is
                from God and became flesh. This is how we can trust in the
                ending of chapter 3. If we know the spirit is trustworthy, and
                it confirms he lives in us, then we are assured of our
                salvation. We can go to God and pray inline with his will and
                receive whatever we ask.

                    4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them,
                    because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is
                    in the world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We Christ in us and he is greater than satan who is in this
                world.

                    5 They are from the world and therefore speak from the
                    viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We
                    are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but
                    whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how
                    we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of
                    falsehood.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Regular people speak worldly wisdom, and it makes sense to the
                world. We speak heavenly wisdom and so only fellow christians
                understand us. Jesus says this in John 12:37-40. Jesus is
                quoting Isaiah 6:10.

                    7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from
                    God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
                    8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is
                    love.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>This verse seems pretty self explanatory.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    9 This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one
                    and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
                    10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us
                    and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                True love is an open handed gift. No strings attached. We didn’t
                first love God then he sent Jesus. He lovingly sent Jesus so
                that we could have the opportunity to love God.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    11 Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to
                    love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; but if we
                    love one another, God lives in us and his love is made
                    complete in us.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                If we love one another God lives in us and his love is made
                complete in us. We show God’s love through us to others.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    13 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He
                    has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify
                    that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the
                    world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of
                    God, God lives in them and they in God. 16 And so we know
                    and rely on the love God has for us.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So we have proven how to trust the spirit, and the apostles have
                seen Jesus along with others post resurrection. With these two
                things we know if anyone acknowledges Jesus is the saviour God
                lives in them. With that we simply rely on the love God has for
                us.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in
                    them. 17 This is how love is made complete among us so that
                    we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this
                    world we are like Jesus. 18 There is no fear in love. But
                    perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with
                    punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                In this world we must live like Jesus. Live in love. The famous
                verse 18 is pretty clear.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>19 We love because he first loved us.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Verse 19 is the crux of the issue. The main backing point of
                this argument.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    20 Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister
                    is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and
                    sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have
                    not seen. 21 And he has given us this command: Anyone who
                    loves God must also love their brother and sister.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John proves this argument by saying if you can’t love people how
                can you love God? If we are trying to be like Christ, Christ
                loves everyone. So should we. John here states it is a command,
                not a suggestion. This point is required, not optional.
