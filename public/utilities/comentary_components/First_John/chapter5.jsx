                <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
                <p>
                    1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of
                    God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as
                    well.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So everyone who believes in Jesus is a part of God’s family.
                Like Paul would say, we are grafted into God’s family along with
                all the jews Galatians 3:29.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs
                according to the promise.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also called to love God's children. We are all children
                of God so we must love everyone.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    2 This is how we know that we love the children of God: by
                    loving God and carrying out his commands. 3 In fact, this is
                    love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not
                    burdensome, 4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world.
                    This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our
                    faith.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So love is action. We must show love. Keeping God’s commandments
                is how we show our love for God. Everyone who is born of God can
                overcome the world. Every follower of Jesus has victory over
                sin. Does this mean every human? No, the next verse clues us in
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    5 Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who
                    believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Believing in Jesus is the only way we gain access to this power.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">

                    6 This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ.
                    He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And
                    it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the
                    truth.

                <p>
                    a. <strong>He who came by water and blood</strong>: John
                    makes it clear that the Jesus he speaks of is not the
                    Gnostic, “phantom” Jesus who was so holy that He had nothing
                    to do with this world. The Jesus we must believe in is the
                    Jesus who
                    <strong>came by water and blood</strong>; the Jesus who was
                    part of a real, material, flesh-and-blood earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. John returns to a theme he started with in the beginning
                    of the letter: the real, historical foundation for our trust
                    in Jesus Christ. In{' '}

                        1 John 1:1
                    </a>
                    -3 the emphasis was on what was <em>seen</em> and{' '}
                    <em>heard</em> and
                    <em>looked upon</em> and <em>handled</em> – real stuff, real
                    people, real things. Just like water and blood are real, so
                    was the coming of the Son of God, Jesus Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. <strong>He who came by water and blood</strong>: Through
                    the centuries, there have been many different ideas about
                    exactly what John meant by this phrase. “This is the most
                    perplexing passage in the Epistle and one of the most
                    perplexing in the New Testament.” (Plummer, cited in Boice)
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. Some believe that <strong>water</strong> speaks of{' '}
                    <em>our own baptism</em>, and <strong>blood</strong> speaks
                    of <em>receiving communion</em>, and that John writes of how
                    Jesus comes to us in the two Christian sacraments of baptism
                    and communion (Luther and Calvin had this idea). Yet, if
                    this is the case, it doesn’t add up with the historical
                    perspective John had when he wrote “
                    <strong>
                        <em>came</em> by water and blood
                    </strong>
                    .” He seems to write of something that happened in the past,
                    not something that is ongoing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. Others (such as Augustine) believe the{' '}
                    <strong>water and blood</strong>
                    describes the water and blood which flowed from Jesus’ side
                    when He was stabbed with a spear on the cross:{' '}
                    <em>
                        But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear,
                        and immediately blood and water came out
                    </em>{' '}
                    (
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+19.34&t=NKJV">
                        John 19:34
                    </a>
                    ). This was an important event to the Apostle John because
                    immediately after this description of water and blood, he
                    added in his gospel:{' '}
                    <em>
                        And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is
                        true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that
                        you may believe
                    </em>{' '}
                    (
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+19.35&t=NKJV">
                        John 19:35
                    </a>
                    ). Yet, if this was John’s meaning, it is a little unclear
                    how it can be said that Jesus{' '}
                    <strong>
                        <em>came</em> by water and blood
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    iii. Still others believe the <strong>water</strong> spoke
                    of Jesus’ first birth, being born of the “waters of the
                    womb,” and <strong>blood</strong> speaks of His death. If
                    this is the case, John would be essentially writing, “Jesus
                    was born like a man and died like a man. He was completely
                    human, not some super-spiritual being who had no real
                    contact with the material world.” The Gnostics in John’s day
                    thought of Jesus as just such a super-spiritual being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. <strong>He who came by water and blood</strong>: Probably
                    the best explanation (though there are good points to some
                    of the other ideas) is the oldest recorded Christian
                    understanding of this passage (first recorded by the ancient
                    Christian Tertullian). Most likely, John means the
                    <strong>water</strong> of Jesus’ baptism, and the{' '}
                    <strong>blood</strong> of His crucifixion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. When Jesus was baptized, He was not baptized in
                    repentance for His own sin (He had none), but because He
                    wanted to completely identify with sinful humanity. When He{' '}
                    <strong>came by water</strong>, it was His way of saying, “I
                    am one of you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. When Jesus died on the cross, He did not die because He
                    had to (death could have no power over Him), but He laid
                    down His life to identify with sinful humanity and to save
                    us from our sin. When He <strong>came by… blood</strong> it
                    was so that He could stand in our place as a guilty sinner,
                    and to take the punishment our sin deserved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iii. This explanation also connects best with what Jesus
                    said in{' '}
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+3.5&t=NKJV">
                        John 3:5
                    </a>
                    :{' '}
                    <em>
                        Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of
                        water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God
                    </em>
                    . The being <em>born of water</em> in this passage speaks of
                    the cleansing waters of baptism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    d. <strong>He who came by water and blood</strong>: Some
                    taught (and still teach) that Jesus received the “Christ
                    Spirit” at His baptism, and the “Christ Spirit” left Jesus
                    before He died on the cross (for them, it is unthinkable
                    that God could hang on a cross). But John insisted that
                    Jesus did not only come by the <em>water</em> of baptism,
                    but also by the <strong>blood</strong> of the cross. He was
                    just as much the Son of God on the cross as He was when the
                    Father declared,{' '}
                    <em>You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased</em> (
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+3.22&t=NKJV">
                        Luke 3:22
                    </a>
                    ) at the baptism of Jesus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. We may find it difficult to relate to this ancient manner
                    of trying to avoid the offense of the cross by saying, “It
                    really wasn’t the Son of God who hung on the cross.” But in
                    our modern age we have our own ways of trying to avoid the
                    offense of the cross. Some deny Jesus was God at all, and
                    just think of Him as a “noble martyr.” Some trivialize the
                    cross, making it a mere ornament in jewelry and pop fashion
                    trends. Others replace the cross with a self-help,
                    self-esteem gospel of psychology, or use a crossless
                    evangelism.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John also says we can trust this because the spirit who
                testifies this and the spirit is truth.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    7 For there are three that testify: 8 the Spirit, the water
                    and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 9 We accept
                    human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it
                    is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                John's testimony is true, but God’s testimony about Jesus is
                even more trustworthy.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    10 Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this
                    testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to
                    be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God
                    has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God
                    has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12
                    Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son
                    of God does not have life.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                If you don’t believe in Jesus being the messiah you are making
                God out to be a liar. Of course God is no liar. So we must
                believe all that Jesus said. Verse 12 is the definitive answer
                here. If you have Jesus you are saved, but if you don’t have
                Jesus you don’t have eternal life.
            </p>
            <p>John then ends his letter with some affirmations.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of
                    the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal
                    life. 14 This is the confidence we have in approaching God:
                    that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
                    15 And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know
                    that we have what we asked of him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Having eternal life is inline with God’s will, so if we ask we
                know God will answer us. Be assured of your faith.

                    life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death.
                    There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you
                    should pray about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, and there

                John here is talking about everyday sin. Stumbling blocks people

                    : When we see a brother in sin, John tells us the first
                    thing to do is to <em>pray</em>
                    for that person. All too often, prayer is the <em>

                    to bless the prayer made on behalf of a brother in sin.
                    Perhaps such prayers have special power before God because
                    they are prayers in fulfillment of the command to love the
                    brethren. Surely, we love each other best when we pray for
                    each other.

                <p>
                    c. <strong>There is sin leading to death</strong>: Because
                    John wrote in the context of a <strong>brother</strong>, it
                    is wrong to see him meaning a sin leading to{' '}
                    <strong>spiritual </strong>
                    death; he probably meant a sin leading to the{' '}
                    <strong>physical </strong>death of the believer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. This is a difficult concept, but we have an example of it
                    in{' '}
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Corinthians+11.27-30&t=NKJV">
                        1 Corinthians 11:27-30
                    </a>
                    , where Paul says that among the Christians in Corinth,
                    because of their disgraceful conduct at the Lord’s Supper,
                    some had died (
                    <em>many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep</em>).
                    This death came not as a condemning judgment, but as a
                    corrective judgment (
                    <em>
                        But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord,
                        that we may{' '}
                    </em>
                    not<em> be condemned with the world</em> [
                    <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Corinthians+11.32&t=NKJV">
                        1 Corinthians 11:32
                    </a>
                    ]).
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. Apparently, a believer <em>can</em> sin to the point
                    where God believes it is just best to bring them home,
                    probably because they have in some way compromised their
                    testimony so significantly that they should just come on
                    home to God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iii. However, it is certainly presumptuous to think this
                    about every case of an untimely death of a believer, or to
                    use it as an enticement to suicide for the guilt-ridden
                    Christian. Our lives are in God’s hands, and if <em>He</em>{' '}
                    sees fit to bring one of His children home, that is fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iv. Some believe that <strong>brother</strong> is used here
                    in a very loose sense, and what John means by the{' '}
                    <strong>sin leading to death</strong> is the blasphemy of
                    the Holy Spirit, which is the willful, settled rejection of
                    Jesus Christ. But this would be a curious use of the term{' '}
                    <strong>brother</strong>, especially according to how John
                    has already used <strong>brother</strong> in his own letter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    d.{' '}
                    <strong>I do not say that he should pray about that</strong>
                    : Apparently, when a Christian is being corrected in regard
                    to a <strong>sin leading to death</strong>, there is no
                    point in praying for his recovery or restoration – the
                    situation is in God’s hands alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e. <strong>There is sin not leading to death</strong>: John
                    takes pains to recognize that not <em>every</em> sin leads
                    to death in the manner he speaks of, though{' '}
                    <strong>all unrighteousness is sin</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I honestly have no idea how I feel about this subject. It is an
                interesting one and something to maybe do further research on.
            </p>
            <p>John continues with the ending of the letter.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    18 We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin;
                    the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil
                    one cannot harm them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>We have victory over sin because we are children of god.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    19 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole
                    world is under the control of the evil one.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>We are children of God and satan rules this world.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                {' '}
                <p>
                    20 We know also that the Son of God has come and has given
                    us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And
                    we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ.
                    He is the true God and eternal life.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We also see that we have spiritual discernment and wisdom from
                God. Listen to the Spirits leading and advice. Jesus calls it
                the advocate for a reason.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>21 Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                A curious ending for a letter. No hey love you guys! Goodbye,
                hope you keep the faith! Just simply stay away from idols. We
                see that upon further inspection this is a fitting end. Idols
                can be anything, yourself, work, money, boyfriend/girlfriend,
                hobby, food. John here is calling us children, an endearing
                use of the word. We must stay away from falling into making
                things our idols. We must have that personal relationship with
                God.
