                <p>
                    1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard,
                    which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at
                    and our hands have touchedâ€”this we proclaim concerning the
                    Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and
                    testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life,
                    which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We
                    proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you
                    also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with
                    the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.

                So this is a strong opening. John is telling us of the fact that
                Jesus lived. He was the word and was also with the father. He is
                eternal life. John and all the apostles have witnessed and
                preached about Christ so that others may join in the fellowship.
                John is speaking only in facts.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    5 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to
                    you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>This is John's first point. He then explains this point.</p>

            <div className="bible">
                {' '}
                <p>
                    6 If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in
                    the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7 But if
                    we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
                    fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his
                    Son, purifies us from all sin.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Honestly, you could just end the letter here. Actions are
                evidence of our faith. Of course John is going to elaborate on
                this idea.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and
                    the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is
                    faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us
                    from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned,
                    we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So at first glance this seemed odd to me. Am I not blameless as
                a follower of Christ? God sees Christ when he looks at me, not
                my sin right? Well context is key here. Some people were not
                first acknowledging their sin pre-Christ saving grace. We are
                all sinners, saved by grace, through faith alone. If we had no
                sin we would not need Christ. Our sins are forgiven, God does
                not remember them anymore, but we still did them. So we
                christains must remain humble in that we to have sinned.
