                    1 “And now, this commandment is for you, the priests. 2 If
                    you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to
                    give honor to My name,” says the Lord of armies, “then I
                    will send the curse upon you and I will curse your
                    blessings; and indeed, I have cursed them already, because
                    you are not taking it to heart.

            <p>
                So the nation as a whole is failing. Even the priests themselves
                are failing. On a somber note we see that even if this was
                headed, not 400 years later they fall back into the same trap.
                By Jesus time we are back in the same place. The sadducees are
                almost completely corrupt.

                    3 Behold, I am going to rebuke your descendants, and I will
                    spread dung on your faces, the dung of your feasts; and you
                    will be taken away with it. 4 Then you will know that I have
                    sent this commandment to you, so that My covenant may
                    continue with Levi,” says the Lord of armies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                God is going to let them know they are not following God’s
                commands. He made a covenant with the levites, and he intends to
                continue it. And there will be levites who feel the same way.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">

                    5 “My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I
                    gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered Me
                    and was in awe of My name. 6 True instruction was in his
                    mouth and injustice was not found on his lips; he walked
                    with Me in peace and justice, and he turned many back from
                    wrongdoing.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is the way it should be working. Sadly it was not working
                this way.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                
                <p>
                    7 For the lips of a priest should maintain knowledge, and
                    people should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the
                    messenger of the Lord of armies. 8 But as for you, you have
                    turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble
                    by the instruction; you have ruined the covenant of Levi,”
                    says the Lord of armies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is super practical in today's day and age. Pastors and
                people in spiritual leadership roles should be people we can
                seek wisdom from. If we fall into that category we must be
                careful to not cause people to stumble.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">

                    9 “So I also have made you despised and of low reputation in
                    the view of all the people, since you are not keeping My
                    ways but are showing partiality in the instruction.”

            </div>

            <p>
                So God has made it known to the people. They are under no
                illusion that these priests are acting the way they should. We
                see this later in Jesus' day. The Essians are priests who see
                through the Sadducees' corruption and leave. Now this is not the
                correct solution. But God will give us guidance to see through
                false teaching. Especially now that we have the spirit.

            <p>We then move to argument number 4</p>
            <div className="bible">
                
                <p>
                    10 Do we not all have one Father? Is it not one God who has
                    created us? Why do we deal treacherously, each against his
                    brother so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Because we are all God’s creation, we are all brothers and
                sisters. To take it one step further, we all came from Noah and
                his line. Even more so for Jews they are all from Abraham. We
                too are from Abraham as chrisstians. We were grafted into
                Abrahams line. Yet don’t treat others like brothers or sisters
                in Christ.

            <div className="bible">
                
                <p>
                    11 Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has
                    been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has
                    profaned the sanctuary of the Lord which He loves, and has
                    married the daughter of a foreign god. 12 As for the man who
                    does this, may the Lord eliminate from the tents of Jacob
                    everyone who is awake and answers, or who presents an
                    offering to the Lord of armies.

            </div>

            <p>
                So God’s judgment is harsh for these priests who are being
                unequally yoked. Even to the point of death it would seem. To be
                removed as a priest at least. Enduring words has some good
                insight on this

                    <strong>
                        May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who
                        does this, being awake and aware, yet who brings an
                        offering
                    </strong>
                    : God promised to punish the priests who married foreign,
                    pagan wives and thought that it would not affect their
                    service of the LORD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i. <strong>Awake and aware</strong> is a difficult phrase to
                    translate. Other translations have “master and scholar,”
                    “tempter and tempted,” “witness and advocate,” “kilth and
                    kin,” or even “nomads and settlers.” “Obviously, the Hebrew
                    idiom is just another way of saying ‘everyone’” (Alden).
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. God’s command against mixed marriages in Israel had
                    nothing to do with race, but with faith. There is even a
                    foreign wife in the genealogy of Jesus – Ruth was a Moabite
                    who married a Jewish man named Boaz; but she forsook Moab’s
                    gods for the LORD (

                Knowing you are in sin, yet pretending it does not affect your
                worship of God is a grave sin. One I’m certainly guilty of. We
                must always repent and serve God with a clean heart.

                    13 And this is another thing you do: you cover the altar of
                    the Lord with tears, with weeping and sighing, because He no
                    longer gives attention to the offering or accepts it with
                    favor from your hand. 14 Yet you say, “For what reason?”
                    Because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife
                    of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously,
                    though she is your marriage companion and your wife by
                    covenant.

                Even though this marriage to ungodly people is wrong, divorcing
                them is still wrong. God is bringing up that these priests are
                not staying faithful to their wives. These wives weep on the
                altar, then these ungodly priests offer sacrifices on the same
                altar.

                    15 But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit.
                    And why the one? He was seeking a godly offspring. Be
                    careful then about your spirit, and see that none of you
                    deals treacherously against the wife of your youth. 16 “For
                    I hate divorce,” says the Lord, the God of Israel, “and him
                    who covers his garment with violence,” says the Lord of
                    armies. “So be careful about your spirit, that you do not
                    deal treacherously.”

            <p>
                God brings up that the priests who still love God are not doing
                this. They are seeking Godly offspring. To raise up a Godly
                household.

                I love this section because even though marrying these people is
                wrong, that does not give you permission to neglect them. God
                still cares about these gentile wives. He does not want to
                neglect them. Even if the circumstances are a little muddy. This
                makes perfect sense as later Paul would say the same thing.
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A10-16&version=NASB">
                    1 Corinthians 7:10-16
                </a>
                of course Paul is speaking under the inspired direction of God.
                He makes that very clear in this section.

                    “How have we wearied Him?” In that you say, “Everyone who
                    does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and He delights
                    in them,” or, “Where is the God of justice?”

                The jews are so bold as to claim God is promoting injustice.
                That the God of justice has abandoned them. They claim that only
                the evil seem to be prospering. This is argument number 5.
