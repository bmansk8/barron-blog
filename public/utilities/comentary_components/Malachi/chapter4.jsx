                    1“ For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace;
                    and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and
                    the day that is coming will set them ablaze,” says the Lord
                    of armies, “so that it will leave them neither root nor
                    branches. 2 But for you who fear My name, the sun of
                    righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; and you
                    will go forth and frolic like calves from the stall.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God is calling us to look to eternity. The chaff will be
                burned away, but we who follow God will remain. We will be
                frolicing in the field like a calf. I love this playful imagery.
                We will be concerned about nothing, simply enjoying God’s
                presence.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    3 And you will crush the wicked underfoot, for they will be
                    ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I am
                    preparing,” says the Lord of armies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We will be filled with so much joy, jumping and frolicing like a
                calf, we will crush the wicked under our feet. Like ashes under
                our feet the bible says.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    4 “Remember the Law of Moses My servant, the statutes and
                    ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel. 5
                    “Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before
                    the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord. 6 He
                    will turn the hearts of the fathers back to their children
                    and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I
                    will not come and strike the land with complete
                    destruction.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So we get a final reason why we should follow the Lord. God will
                send us Elijah to let us know so we might be saved. God is not
                seeking complete destruction. Just like John the baptist before
                Christ, there will be a period before complete destruction.
                Personally this strongly points to the 7 year tribulation. A
                final chance to turn to God.
