                    1 “Behold, I am sending My messenger, and he will clear a
                    way before Me. And the Lord, whom you are seeking, will
                    suddenly come to His temple; and the messenger of the
                    covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming,” says
                    the Lord of armies.

                So this is where we get our idea of John the baptist from. John
                the Baptist is this Elijah-like figure that precedes Christ.
                Then we of course see Christ suddenly show up on the scene. In
                Matthew’s gospel chapter 3, we see John the baptist preaching
                then Jesus arrives. Just like the above scripture. John's gospel
                by verse 6 of chapter one introduces us to John the baptist.
                John's gospel also has Jesus cleansing the temple in chapter 2.
                An earlier cleansing that takes place almost right at the
                beginning. Just as the above verses state.

                This can also point to Christ's second coming as well because of
                the following verses. It is not uncommon to be talking about
                both comings of Christ.
            </p>

                    2 “But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can
                    stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner’s fire, and
                    like launderer’s soap. 3 And He will sit as a smelter and
                    purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and
                    refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present
                    to the Lord offerings in righteousness. 4 Then the offering
                    of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in
                    the days of old, and as in former years.

                    “If any of you, my hearers, are seeking the Lord at this
                    time, I want you to understand what it means: you are
                    seeking a fire which will test you, and consume much which
                    has been dear to you. We are not to expect Christ to come
                    and save us in our sins, he will come and save us from our
                    sins; therefore, if you are enabled by faith to take Christ
                    as a Savior, remember that you take him as the purger and
                    the purifier, for it is from sin that he saves us.”{' '}

                    <strong>He will sit as a refiner</strong>. The sitting
                    posture shows that the refiner may seem indifferent, but He
                    is not. He is carefully working with the silver, burning off
                    and scraping away the dross that that the flames bring to
                    the top. “I think I see in the sitting down of the refiner a
                    settled patience, as if he seemed to say, ‘This is stern
                    work, and I will sit down to it, for it will need care, and
                    time, and constant watchfulness’” <em>(Spurgeon)</em>.

                God seeks judgment, so we might be pure before him. Not simply
                for the sake of judging. So he can spend eternity with us. All
                of this is possible because of Christ.

                    5 “Then I will come near to you for judgment; and I will be
                    a swift witness against the sorcerers, the adulterers,
                    against those who swear falsely, those who oppress the wage
                    earner in his wages or the widow or the orphan, and those
                    who turn away the stranger from justice and do not fear Me,”
                    says the Lord of armies.

                So God’s judgment is here to set things right. Then God will be
                our witness for all the injustice we have received. It will be
                swift. Those people who are not practicing shalom, community,
                helping the orphan and widow, the ones who are interpreting
                Torah incorrectly. We as christians should strive to not fall
                into any of these categories God will judge us on. And if we do
                we must be thankful that Christ has freed us from our sins, and
                stumbling.

                God wants them to return to him, yet they don’t even know how.
                They are unaware they are not with God. how can we return if we
                are already with you God? This is our 6th argument.

                So the jews are robbing God of what is rightfully his. Not that
                God needs it. It is an obedience thing. God points out the
                foolishness of this. They are robbing themselves of God’s
                blessings by doing this.

                So we now in the bible it says to not test God. Jesus quotes

                </a>
                , yet God makes an exception for us here. Let us get the whole
                context.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">

                    that it will not destroy the fruit of your ground; nor will
                    the vine in the field prove fruitless to you,” says the Lord

            <p>
                God wants to bless us! But he first requires obedience. We
                should also understand God’s blessings are not always what we
                think of. They are not worldly but eternal. A true friend, a
                loved one being saved, having just enough when there was lack,
                heavenly peace. The strong move of God when you need him most.
                God is challenging us. You cannot outgive the lord.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now plenty of people will use this to take up money in a church,
                or to shy away from Christianity and that is a money-based
                religion. It is important that God tells us to do this. We must
                also understand that this is to be put in the store house. This
                is meant to bless the orphan and the widow. Not simply to pay a
                salary and keep the lights on. To bring shalom to everyone. If
                we are not obedient, and not using it for God’s purpose, we are
                missing the point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now preachers and people within the church have to survive
                somehow. And we are all human so at some point something will go
                wrong when it comes to money in the church. But the focus is far
                more on the people doing the tithing. Not the temple or the
                levites in the particular verse. God will judge those people,
                not us. We are simply called to test God in this. He will still
                bless us whether or not our money is being used well.

                    13 “Your words have been arrogant against Me,” says the
                    Lord. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against You?’ 14
                    You have said, ‘It is pointless to serve God; and what
                    benefit is it for us that we have done what He required, and
                    that we have walked in mourning before the Lord of armies?
                    15 So now we call the arrogant blessed; not only are the
                    doers of wickedness built up, but they also put God to the
                    test and escape punishment.’ ”

                Just wow… such boldness to call out God like that. Yet I have
                done exactly that before. Sometimes it does not seem like God is
                honoring who he should. It seems like evil people are getting
                away with it. To be even more ignorant to what God is saying.
                Now he is challenging those evil people to give him money, and
                he will bless them! But we see the solution.

                Community happened. They debated this current situation. People
                laid bare their frustrations with God. “And the Lord listened
                attentively” is what the bible says. God was not butt hurt and
                abandoned them. He listened. He understood their pain. They also
                remembered all that God had done for them in the past.

                    compassion for them just as a man has compassion for his own
                    son who serves him.” 18 So you will again distinguish
                    between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves
                    God and one who does not serve Him.

                These people will be the Lord’s. Just like how sometimes a son
                does not understand his dad’s plan and questions it, the Lord
                will not rebuke us for asking why sometimes. He will have
                compassion on us. Because these people are obedient to God, even
                when they don’t understand. Even when they have doubts or
                questions. God makes a promise that someday we will be able to
                see who is God’s and who is not. When eternity comes it will be
                obvious who is serving God and who is not.
