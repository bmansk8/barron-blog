            <p>So we start with argument 1</p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    1 The pronouncement of the word of the Lord to Israel
                    through Malachi:
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 “I have loved you,” says the Lord. But you say, “How have
                    You loved us?” “Was Esau not Jacob’s brother?” declares the
                    Lord. “Yet I have loved Jacob; 3 but I have hated Esau, and
                    I have made his mountains a desolation and given his
                    inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So the jews are arguing with God. Do you even love me, God? God
                points out that he loved Jacob instead of Esau. Jacob was his
                chosen patriarch, even though he did a lot wrong in his life.
                Even now Esau’s descendants are robbed of their inheritance.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    4 Though Edom says, “We have been beaten down, but we will
                    return and build up the ruins”; this is what the Lord of
                    armies says: “They may build, but I will tear down; and
                    people will call them the territory of wickedness, and the
                    people with whom the Lord is indignant forever.” 5 And your
                    eyes will see this, and you will say, “The Lord be exalted
                    beyond the border of Israel!”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                If God has said he will do something, he will. Even if it takes
                all of eternity. Even at the time of this prophet, God is still
                doing what he said he would.
            </p>
            <p>Now argument 2</p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    6 “ ‘A son honors his father, and a servant his master. Then
                    if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master,
                    where is My respect?’ says the Lord of armies to you, the
                    priests who despise My name! But you say, ‘How have we
                    despised Your name?’
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God is not receiving his deserved respect. The priest, both
                the actual priest, and the nation as a whole are not respecting
                him. The nation of priests is not being very priestly. So much
                so they are unaware of their shortcomings.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    7 You are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But you
                    say, ‘How have we defiled You?’ In that you say, ‘The table
                    of the Lord is to be despised.’ 8 And when you present a
                    blind animal for sacrifice, is it not evil? Or when you
                    present a lame or sick animal, is it not evil? So offer it
                    to your governor! Would he be pleased with you, or would he
                    receive you kindly?” says the Lord of armies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Their sacrifices are not up to God’s standard. They are not
                truly sacrificing anything to God. True sacrifice cost us
                something. Sacrificing a sick animal is not much of a sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note that we are seeing God being referred to as the lord
                of armies. This is also used 272 other times in the NASB 2020
                version of the bible. Both in the new and old testament. Over 24
                times alone in this book. God is invoking his power over all
                armies and nations. He is a warrior God and all nations serve
                him. He is almighty and in control over everything. The exile
                that the jews just came out of proves this point. It was a tool
                God was using to try to bring about repentance and a change of
                heart. Because this book is tackling their lack of respect I’m
                not surprised God is being referred to this way.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    9 “But now, do indeed plead for God’s favor, so that He will
                    be gracious to us. With such an offering on your part, will
                    He receive any of you kindly?” says the Lord of armies. 10
                    “If only there were one among you who would shut the gates,
                    so that you would not kindle fire on My altar for nothing! I
                    am not pleased with you,” says the Lord of armies, “nor will
                    I accept an offering from your hand. 11 For from the rising
                    of the sun even to its setting, My name shall be great among
                    the nations, and in every place frankincense is going to be
                    offered to My name, and a grain offering that is pure; for
                    My name shall be great among the nations,” says the Lord of
                    armies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                God would rather them not offer anything than offer these
                worthless sacrifices. God will receive his just offering,
                whether it is from the jews or not. Of course if you are looking
                forward, John confirms this
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    Revelation 5:13 And I heard every created thing which is in
                    heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea,
                    and all the things in them, saying, “To Him who sits on the
                    throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the
                    glory, and the dominion forever and ever.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Philippians 2 is also dealing with Christ obedience to God</p>
            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    9 For this reason also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed
                    on Him the name which is above every name, 10 so that at the
                    name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in
                    heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and that every
                    tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory
                    of God the Father.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                These jews can choose to obey or not, but God<em> will </em>
                receive his just glory.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                
                <p>
                    12 “But you are profaning it by your saying, ‘The table of
                    the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be
                    despised.’
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The jews are saying that what comes from sacrificing to God is
                to be despised. This is an insane level of ignorance. The gifts
                of God that come from worshipping him should be despised. That
                is truly just crazy in my mind.
            </p>
            <div className="bible">
                
                <p>
                    13 You also say, ‘See, how tiresome it is!’ And you view it
                    as trivial,” says the Lord of armies, “and you bring what
                    was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick; so you bring
                    the offering! Should I accept it from your hand?” says the
                    Lord.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                It’s just a chore to them. And those who sacrifice do so at the
                expenses of others. Not themselves.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    14 “But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock
                    and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord,
                    for I am a great King,” says the Lord of armies, “and My
                    name is feared among the nations.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Among the nations can also be gentiles. This absolutely came
                true once Christ came. Now there are more gentiles who fear God
                than jews.
