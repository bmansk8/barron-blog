                <p>
                    1 Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies and
                    pillage;
                </p>
                <p>Her prey does not leave.</p>
                <p>2 The sound of the whip,</p>
                <p>The sound of the roar of the wheel,</p>
                <p>Galloping horses</p>
                <p>And bounding chariots!</p>
                <p>3 Horsemen charging,</p>
                <p>Swords flashing, spears gleaming,</p>
                <p>Many killed, a mass of corpses,</p>
                <p>And there is no end to the dead bodies—</p>
                <p>They stumble over the dead bodies!</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So we see the complete devastation of Nineveh. So many are
                killed that they have to walk over the corpses.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>4 All because of the many sexual acts of the prostitute,</p>
                <p>The charming one, the mistress of sorceries,</p>
                <p>Who sells nations by her sexual acts,</p>
                <p>And families by her sorceries.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So we see that this judgment has come from their sin. Their
                sexual sin and sorcery.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    5 “Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of armies;
                </p>
                <p>“And I will lift up your skirts over your face,</p>
                <p>And show the nations your nakedness,</p>
                <p>And the kingdoms your shame.</p>
                <p>6 I will throw filth on you</p>
                <p>And declare you worthless,</p>
                <p>And set you up as a spectacle.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So this is a polite way of stating that God will strip off their
                clothes. All the other nations will see Nineveh naked. Then God
                will throw literal poop or dung onto their faces. He will make a
                spectacle of them.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>7 And it will come about that all who see you</p>
                <p>Will shrink from you and say,</p>
                <p>‘Nineveh is devastated!</p>
                <p>Who will have sympathy for her?’</p>
                <p>Where shall I seek comforters for you?”</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                All the other nations will not want anything to do with what is
                left of Nineveh, and by extension Assyria.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>8 Are you better than No-amon,</p>
                <p>Which was situated by the canals of the Nile,</p>
                <p>With water surrounding her,</p>
                <p>Whose rampart was the sea,</p>
                <p>Whose wall consisted of the sea?</p>
                <p>9 Ethiopia was her might,</p>
                <p>Egypt too, without limits.</p>
                <p>Put and Lubim were among her helpers.</p>
                <p>10 Yet she became an exile,</p>
                <p>She went into captivity;</p>
                <p>Also her small children were smashed to pieces</p>
                <p>At the head of every street;</p>
                <p>They cast lots for her honorable men,</p>
                <p>And all her great men were bound with shackles.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So this is referring to the sack of Thebes. The Assyrians
                attacked the city then controlled by Egyptian 25th dynasty.
                Thebes is remarkably similar to Nineveh in terms of its standing
                as a great city. At one time it might have been the biggest city
                of the time period. It also was a capital a few times and was
                associated with immense wealth. It is a remarkably similar
                parallel to the destruction of Nineveh and the Assyrians would
                be extremely familiar with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also helps us understand when Nahum was written with a
                strong level of certainty. The sacking of nineveh would also
                come to pass shortly after the sack of Thebes.

            <div className="bible">
                <p>11 You too will become drunk,</p>
                <p>You will be hidden.</p>
                <p>You too will search for a refuge from the enemy.</p>
                <p>
                    Just like Thebes, Assyria will seek refuge from its enemies.
                </p>
                <p>12 All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit—</p>
                <p>When shaken, they fall into the eater’s mouth.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                All the fortifications Assyria has set up, worthless. It will be
                easy to capture. As easy as picking ripe fruit off a tree.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>13 Behold, your people are women in your midst!</p>
                <p>The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies;</p>
                <p>Fire consumes your gate bars.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I’m unsure as to the exact meaning of this verse. I understand
                it to mean the men are lacking in any manly qualities when faced
                with battle. They are acting like women. Not fighting but
                fleeing with fear.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>14 Draw for yourself water for a siege!</p>
                <p>Strengthen your fortifications!</p>
                <p>Go into the clay and tread the mortar!</p>
                <p>Take hold of the brick mold!</p>
                <p>15 There fire will consume you,</p>
                <p>The sword will cut you down;</p>
                <p>
                    It will consume you as the creeping locust consumes a crop.
                </p>
                <p>Multiply yourself like the creeping locust,</p>
                <p>Multiply yourself like the migratory locust.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I think verse 14 is almost mocking Nineveh's efforts to save
                themselves. Do whatever you want to prepare, but you will be cut
                down. Fire will consume you.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    16 You have made your traders more numerous than the stars
                    of heaven—
                </p>
                <p>The creeping locust sheds its skin and flies away.</p>
                <p>17 Your courtiers are like the migratory locust.</p>
                <p>Your officials are like a swarm of locusts</p>
                <p>Settling in the stone shelters on a cold day.</p>
                <p>The sun rises and they flee,</p>
                <p>And the place where they are is not known.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I’m unsure of the locust comparison here. I suppose all they do
                is consume and destroy, and in that sense are of no help to
                Nineveh. Useless bugs.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>18 Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria;</p>
                <p>Your officers are lying down.</p>
                <p>Your people are scattered on the mountains</p>
                <p>And there is no one to gather them.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Like a swarm of locusts, the Assyrians came, destroyed, and now
                disperse. That way of life can not go on forever. A group of
                locusts cannot hope to stand against God.

            </div>

            <p>
                Nineveh's doom is inevitable. Nothing will be able to heal this
                wound. In the end the righteous triumph over the unrighteous.
