                <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
                <p>
                    1 The pronouncement of Nineveh. The book of the vision of
                    Nahum the Elkoshite:
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So a standard opening for a prophet. We also see oddly enough
                this is for Assyria, specifically the city of Nineveh. Even pre
                Christ God was speaking to gentiles. Not in the freedom we have
                post Christ. But if they had gone looking, they would have found
                him.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>2 A jealous and avenging God is the Lord;</p>
                <p>The Lord is avenging and wrathful.</p>
                <p>The Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries,</p>
                <p>And He reserves wrath for His enemies.</p>
                <p>3 The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,</p>
                <p>
                    And the Lord will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.
                </p>
                <p>In the gale and the storm is His way,</p>
                <p>And clouds are the dust beneath His feet.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So as I often bring up, God is long suffering. But as we see
                here he can not tolerate sin. The guilty cannot avoid judgment.
                Even if God is slow to anger and long suffering so none might
                perish.
            </p>
            <p>
                The end of 3 also points out God’s position in the world. He is
                above it. He is in the wind and strom. Yet the clouds are dust
                beneath his feet. He is higher than this world.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>4 He rebukes the sea and dries it up;</p>
                <p>He dries up all the rivers.</p>
                <p>Bashan and Carmel wither,</p>
                <p>The blossoms of Lebanon wither.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The flood story is the opposite of this. So God can do whatever
                he wants. He can take away and add as he pleases.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>5 Mountains quake because of Him,</p>
                <p>And the hills come apart;</p>
                <p>Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence,</p>
                <p>The world and all the inhabitants in it.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                With all the mighty things man has accomplished, we have not
                ripped hills apart and made the mountains quake. Only God can
                make the whole world feel his presence.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>6 Who can stand before His indignation?</p>
                <p>Who can endure the burning of His anger?</p>
                <p>His wrath gushes forth like fire,</p>
                <p>And the rocks are broken up by Him.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is a crazy description. I would jump to lava being
                described here. Like a volcano exploding God’s wrath might take
                awhile, but once it arrives none can withstand it.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>7 The Lord is good,</p>
                <p>A stronghold in the day of trouble,</p>
                <p>And He knows those who take refuge in Him.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We get a quick reminder that God knows the sheep from the goats.
                If you are one of his people he is a mighty stronghold.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>8 But with an overflowing flood</p>
                <p>He will make a complete end of its site,</p>
                <p>And will pursue His enemies into darkness.</p>
                <p>9 Whatever you devise against the Lord,</p>
                <p>He will make a complete end of it.</p>
                <p>Distress will not rise up twice.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So God is talking about Nineveh here. God will not allow them to
                rise up and cause destruction and sin upon his people twice.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>10 Like tangled thorns,</p>
                <p>And like those who are drunken with their drink,</p>
                <p>They are consumed</p>
                <p>Like stubble completely dried up.</p>
                <p>11 From you has gone out</p>
                <p>One who plotted evil against the Lord,</p>
                <p>A wicked counselor.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Even the tiny stubble of the crops will be destroyed. I’m not
                sure about elsewhere but in Montana you leave the stubble in the
                field so the next year you will have enough water in the soil.
                The stubble is small and useless. But God is saying not even the
                stubble will be left. There will be no crop this year, or the
                next. And you couldn’t even try to eat the stubble if you wanted
                to. His judgment is absolute and complete.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>12 This is what the Lord says:</p>
                <p>“Though they are at full strength and so they are many,</p>
                <p>So also they will be cut off and pass away.</p>
                <p>Though I have afflicted you,</p>
                <p>I will afflict you no longer.</p>
                <p>13 So now, I will break his yoke from upon you,</p>
                <p>And I will tear your shackles to pieces.”</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We now see a switch to talking to Judah. God acknowledges that
                Assryia was a tool he was using. But he will break that yoke off
                the jews.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>14 The Lord has issued a command concerning</p>
                <p>you: “Your name will no longer be perpetuated.</p>
                <p>
                    I will eliminate the carved image and the cast metal image
                </p>
                <p>From the house of your gods.</p>
                <p>I will prepare your grave,</p>
                <p>For you are contemptible.”</p>
                <p>
                    We then see the Lord address the king of Nineveh. You could
                    also say the city as a whole.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                God says he himself is preparing their grave. This is such
                strong language being used here. The creator of the universe is
                preparing your grave.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>
                    15 Behold, on the mountains, the feet of him who brings good
                    news,
                </p>
                <p>Who announces peace!</p>
                <p>Celebrate your feasts, Judah,</p>
                <p>Pay your vows.</p>
                <p>For never again will the</p>
                <p>wicked one pass through you;</p>
                <p>He is eliminated completely.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We then see another tonal shift. Hebrew scriptures put this as
                chapter 2.
            </p>
            <h3>Talking point</h3>
            <p>
                So God is calling for party time! The enemy is completely
                defeated. God also states “the wicked one” will never pass
                through you again! Wow, so great. Honestly with hindsight this
                seems very hollow. The Babylonians come and wreck Judah later. I
                suppose one might argue that Judah fails to repent then so this
                promise is voided. But a promise is done regardless of any other
                factors. God’s promises are 100% true and will always be
                fulfilled. God promised Abraham a child, and <em>he had one</em>
                . God in{' '}
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+18&version=NIV">
                    Genesis 18
                </a>{' '}
                asks why Sarah does not believe his promise. He says
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>14 Is anything too hard for the Lord?...</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So this leaves me with a dilemma. Because God’s promises are
                true and always fulfilled. As I said before, with hindsight it
                seems like God didn’t do what he said he would. Now Assyria is
                different to Babylon. So one could also say that Assryia
                specifically never comes against Judah. That also seems a little
                like a half truth. An out of character obfuscation by God.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots of the Prophets bring up these ideas. I’m unsure how to
                resolve that fact. Something to wrestle with I suppose.
