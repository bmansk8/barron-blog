                <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
                <p>1 The one who scatters has come up against you.</p>
                <p>Keep watch over the fortress, watch the road;</p>
                <p>Bind up your waist, summon all your strength.</p>
                <p>2 For the Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob</p>
                <p>Like the splendor of Israel,</p>
                <p>Even though destroyers have laid waste to them</p>
                <p>And ruined their vines.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So now God is talking to Nineveh again. It’s interesting that
                God refers to himself as the one who scatters. I could not find
                another reference to this anywhere in the rest of the bible.
                There is a reference in proverbs but the context is not
                referring to God. Jesus also later uses this phrase but once
                again in a different context.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also see this idea of Jacob and Israel referring to the same
                people group, but in different states. Israel is the way God
                wants the nation to be, but they often end up acting like Jacob
                more often than not. Israel means “God strives” in hebrew. A
                people who are striving after God. Jacob means “heel catcher”.
                Jacob tries early on in life, and later succeeds, to usurp his
                brother's role in the family. God wants a people who strive
                after him instead of trying to usurp everyone around them.

                <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3478.htm">
                    Strong's Hebrew: 3478. יִשְׂרָאֵל (Yisrael) -- "God
                    strives," another name of Jacob and his desc.

                    Strong's Hebrew: 3290. יַעֲקֹב (Yaaqob) -- a son of Isaac,
                    also his desc.
                </a>
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>3 The shields of his warriors are dyed red,</p>
                <p>The warriors are dressed in scarlet,</p>
                <p>The chariots are fitted with flashing steel</p>
                <p>When he is prepared to march,</p>
                <p>And the juniper spears are brandished.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So these warriors of God are fierce. Their shields dyed red and
                clothed in red. Flashing steel can also be on fire. I’m unsure
                if they are red from blood or that is just the color.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>4 The chariots drive wildly in the streets,</p>
                <p>They rush around in the public squares;</p>
                <p>Their appearance is like torches,</p>
                <p>They drive back and forth like lightning flashes.</p>
                <p>5 He remembers his officers;</p>
                <p>They stumble in their advance,</p>
                <p>They hurry to her wall,</p>
                <p>And the mantelet is set up.</p>
                <p>6 The gates of the rivers are opened</p>
                <p>And the palace sways back and forth.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This to me seems like a frantic advance. Like wild animals
                rushing in and killing everyone. Like crazed lunatics just
                advancing without stopping.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>7 It is set:</p>
                <p>She is stripped, she is led away,</p>
                <p>And her slave women are sobbing like the sound of doves,</p>
                <p>Beating their breasts.</p>
                <p>
                    8 Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her
                    days,
                </p>
                <p>Yet they are fleeing;</p>
                <p>“Stop, stop,”</p>
                <p>But no one turns back.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Just like how Assryia led the jews away, they too are now being
                led away like slaves. Everyone else is fleeing. No one is
                seeking to return to this place.
            </p>

            <div className="bible">
                <p>9 Plunder the silver,</p>
                <p>Plunder the gold!</p>
                <p>For there is no end to the treasure—</p>
                <p>Wealth from every kind of desirable object.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So we see that Assyria had acquired vast wealth at the expense
                of others. One important note is that the looting here is
                allowed because it is not the jews doing the looting. The other
                nations that God is working through are the ones raiding
                Nineveh. A little tidbit from Enduring Word.

                    “An impressive confirmation of this prophecy is that nothing

                also points to this. God lies down like a lion, who would dare
                rouse him? God is tearing his prey apart so his lion cubs and
                lionesses might eat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lion is also used a lot to be a fierce animal to face. David
                and Samson both face a lion. The devil is also described as a
                roaring lion prowling around looking for people to devour.

            <p>
                God is using lions as a visual way to think of the descendants
                of Nineveh. Now their lion cubs and lionesses will go hungry.
